Introduction:
Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Rob Gillingham and Bob Spista of Innovative Modular Solutions. They're here today to talk about how well-suited modular construction is for educational buildings and about some specific projects on which they've recently worked. Rob and Bob, thanks for calling in today.

Rob's Background:
Rob, could you tell us about yourself and your background?
Rob Gillingham: Sure, John. Thanks for having us. I've been with Innovative Modular Solutions for a while now. But before that, I had a different career in sales and management in the IT industry. I joined the U.S. Air Force and later moved into project management and operations management. I eventually found my passion for building and construction, which led me to the modular construction industry. It's been a great second career for me.

Bob's Background:
Great. Thanks, Rob. Bob, how about you? What's your background?
Bob Spista: Well, I started in the modular industry back in 1985 and held various sales and management positions within GE Capital Modular Space. I helped Innovative Modular Solutions begin operations in 1999 and later moved to Tennessee to open our Southeast branch in 2008. Since then, we've expanded our sales coverage to include about six states in the Southeastern U.S.

Benefits of Modular Construction in Education:
John McMullen: Thanks for sharing, both of you. Now, generally speaking, what benefits can modular construction bring to the education sector?
Bob Spista: Modular construction can provide schools with several different options for short-term and long-term space requirements. Whether a school is new, expanding, or renovating, modular construction offers a viable solution that can be delivered quickly. For instance, charter schools often lease existing church properties with auditoriums, gyms, and kitchens, allowing them to add modular classrooms as their student population grows.

Rob Gillingham: I completely agree with Bob. The speed of delivery is a key advantage, especially for public schools with limited budgets and strict timelines. Modular construction allows us to meet the needs of schools quickly and efficiently, and we can customize buildings to meet their specific requirements.

Winkelmann Elementary School Expansion Project:
John McMullen: Rob, you recently worked on the Winkelmann Elementary School expansion project. Can you tell us more about how that project got started?
Rob Gillingham: Certainly. The project began when I met the assistant superintendent at the Illinois Association of School Business Officials (IASBO) trade show. She initially contacted me to inquire about removing some old modular buildings on their property that were no longer in use. We successfully handled that, which helped build our relationship.

Later, she reached out again to discuss expanding their existing school to accommodate new programs, including a pre-K program and special needs programs. We worked on the design and layout of the additional space, reviewed it with the district, and once they approved it, we began the project.

Site Preparation:
John McMullen: What was the process for preparing the site for the expansion?
Rob Gillingham: We acted as the general contractor for this project, so we handled all the site work, including working with local municipalities and the Regional Office of Education (ROE) for permitting. We designed the site plan with the district's architect, built a permanent foundation, and set the building on it. We also ran utilities, such as gas and electrical, and completed all the necessary work on-site to ensure the building met code requirements.

Matching the Exterior:
John McMullen: I noticed in the case study that the district wanted the exterior of the expansion to match the existing school building. Can you tell us more about how you achieved that?
Rob Gillingham: Yes, the district was concerned about how the new expansion would blend in with the existing school and the surrounding neighborhood. We had several meetings with various committees, including the appearance committee and the building committee. They wanted to ensure that the new building seamlessly matched the old one.

To achieve this, we had to make sure the brick we used matched the existing school's brick, even though the school was built several years earlier. We collaborated with a local mason to find matching brick samples and presented them during the committee meetings. Ultimately, we used the selected brick to create a veneer on the building after it was transported and set on-site, resulting in a cohesive look that blends seamlessly with the original structure.

Installation Process:
John McMullen: Can you share more details about the installation process itself? Did it cause any disruption to the main school or the students?
Rob Gillingham: Modular construction offers several advantages, one of which is minimal disruption to the site and the students. For the Winkelmann Elementary School project, we acted as the full general contractor, handling all the site work. We completed the building's installation before the school year began, ensuring that it didn't disrupt the students or the school's operations.

The building itself featured high-quality finishes, including gypsum board, LVT tile, ceramic walls and floors in the corridor, floor-to-ceiling ceramic in the restrooms, granite countertops, and ADA-compliant single-use restrooms with hand sinks. The construction process was completed smoothly without impacting the school's function.

Phased Modular Project:
John McMullen: Bob, you mentioned that you worked on a phased modular project for Green Dot Public Schools' Bluff City High School. Could you tell us more about how that project unfolded and the phases involved?
Bob Spista: Certainly, John. Green Dot Public Schools wanted to open a high school in Memphis, but finding an existing facility was challenging. They initially leased church property across from the middle school they had opened a few years earlier. The church had a gym and library, which the schools shared, and we helped them add modular classrooms as their student population grew.

The project was divided into three phases. Phase one involved nine classrooms and administrative space, phase two added ten more classrooms with restrooms connected to phase one, and phase three added 18 classrooms, a teacher resource center, and additional offices. Each phase was completed in a timely manner to accommodate the school's growing needs.

Phased Installation:
John McMullen: How quickly were each of these phases completed and placed on-site?
Bob Spista: Phase one took approximately five months to complete, phase two was completed in three months, and phase three took about five months to finish. We had to make sure that the site, including utilities, parking, and sidewalks, was designed to accommodate all three phases from the beginning. This approach reduced costs and ensured a smooth installation process.

Modular vs. Freestanding Modular Additions:
John McMullen: Rob, Bob, could you share your thoughts on the differences between working on modular expansions and freestanding modular buildings?
Rob Gillingham: One of the significant advantages of modular construction is that we do a lot of pre-design work to anticipate and address potential issues ahead of time. This is different from traditional freestanding construction, which may involve more changes and potential budget impacts due to unforeseen issues during construction. With modular, we identify potential challenges upfront, and once the plan is set, we stay on course, which leads to on-time and on-budget projects.

Bob Spista: I agree with Rob. Modular projects involve a more thorough pre-design phase, which helps minimize changes and surprises during construction. This approach makes the budgeting process more predictable and keeps the project on track. Traditional construction projects can sometimes experience more changes and delays due to unforeseen issues.

Structural and Code Considerations:
John McMullen: Are there any structural or code considerations unique to designing educational buildings with modular construction, or do they closely resemble traditional construction?
Rob Gillingham: From my experience, the structural and code considerations for educational buildings in modular construction closely resemble those of traditional construction. Schools have specific lighting, ventilation, and ADA requirements, which we can easily accommodate in modular construction. Modular buildings are built to meet all relevant codes and standards, ensuring they provide a safe and compliant environment for students and staff.

Bob Spista: I'd echo what Rob mentioned. Modular construction allows us to meet all the requirements and codes for educational buildings, just like traditional construction. We can provide the same features and amenities required for schools, making it a suitable choice for educational projects.

Customization:
John McMullen: How much customization can communities apply to modular buildings to meet the unique needs of their students?
Rob Gillingham: Modular construction is highly customizable, and we've been able to accommodate a wide range of customization requests. Schools can specify their space requirements, interior finishes, and other features to suit their needs. Whether it's the layout of classrooms, specialized facilities, or unique finishes, modular construction can provide the flexibility to meet specific requirements.

Bob Spista: That's correct. Modular construction allows for a high degree of customization, and we work closely with schools to ensure their buildings meet their unique needs. This includes everything from classroom layouts to specialized facilities like science labs or music rooms. The exterior and interior finishes can also be customized to match the school's preferences and branding.

Future Projects:
John McMullen: What projects are you currently working on or planning for the future?
Rob Gillingham: We've recently completed a variety of projects, including public and private school expansions, temporary classroom installations, and building modifications to support social distancing measures. We continue to receive inquiries from schools looking for modular solutions to address their space needs quickly and efficiently.

Bob Spista: In the Southeast, we're wrapping up a large private school project in North Carolina and assisting with the design of several large modular school projects set to be completed next summer. Additionally, we're working on projects involving temporary classrooms and building modifications to meet the evolving needs of schools.

Closing Remarks:
John McMullen: Thank you both for joining us today. It's clear that modular construction has a significant role to play in the education sector, offering speed, customization, and flexibility to meet the unique requirements of schools. We appreciate your insights and the valuable work you're doing in the modular industry.
