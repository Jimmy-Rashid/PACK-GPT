Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Christian Lawrence, founder, and CEO of Rise Modular. Christian is here to talk about how Rise got started and his thoughts on where modular is headed. Christian, thanks for calling in today.

Christian: Thanks for having me.

John: It's my pleasure. So, tell me about yourself. I've read that your background originally was in economics. So, how did you find your way into modular construction?

Christian: Sure, so my background is in finance. I worked in investment banking and private equity. I've always been passionate about real estate and design. About four years ago, I moved back to Minneapolis from the East Coast and got involved in real estate development. I was working on one development deal in particular, a 20-unit apartment building, and I wanted to explore off-site construction and modular specifically. I had read about modular construction being commonplace in parts of Europe and Asia and growing in popularity on the coasts. However, I hadn't seen it done in the Midwest.

I toured several modular companies in the upper Midwest, primarily focused on single-family homes, but none of them could handle a project of the size I was envisioning. That's when I realized there was a significant gap in the market for large-scale commercial modular construction in the Midwest. I became captivated by the idea of industrializing construction in a manufacturing environment, and that's how I got into modular construction.

John: That's a fascinating journey. So, what was the process of starting Rise Modular? What was the first step?

Christian: The first step was conducting market research to validate the concept and demand for commercial modular construction in the Midwest. I mapped out modular companies across the country that could handle a 20-unit apartment building and found a significant white space in the central United States with no suppliers capable of serving this market. I spoke with developers and contractors to validate the demand.

Once we confirmed the demand, the next step was building the right team and finding the right facility. We spent a lot of time assembling a team of industry experts and identifying a facility that could be retrofitted into a state-of-the-art modular manufacturing plant.

John: It sounds like assembling the right team was crucial to your success. Looking at your website, it's evident that you have a strong team. How did you go about building such a team, especially as someone relatively new to the industry?

Christian: We're very proud of the team we've assembled at Rise Modular. We believe we have one of the best teams of experienced industry leaders. We recruited team members from all over the country, including Colorado, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and other states. We cast a wide net to find the right people with the necessary expertise.

Since there are few suppliers in the upper Midwest with experience in large-scale apartment buildings and hotels, it was critical to put together a team capable of handling such projects. Our team members have diverse backgrounds and experiences, and they bring their expertise to every aspect of our operation.

John: That's impressive. So, you mentioned that Rise Modular primarily focuses on multi-family and hospitality projects. Can you elaborate on why you chose to focus on these sectors rather than others?

Christian: Certainly. My initial entry into modular construction was driven by a personal development project, a 20-unit apartment building. I couldn't find a supplier capable of delivering a project of that size in the upper Midwest. After conducting market research, I realized there was significant demand for multi-family and hospitality projects in this region. However, there were no suppliers serving these markets.

Rise Modular was founded to meet that unmet demand. We found that within a 750-mile radius of our plant in Owatonna, Minnesota, over 85% of units in the multi-family and hospitality sectors were built using wood, while less than 15% were built with concrete and steel. Wood construction is cost-effective within this market, making it the natural choice for us. As a result, we've primarily focused on wood-framed modular construction for multi-family and hospitality projects.

John: It makes sense to cater to the existing market demand. Speaking of projects, I understand Rise Modular has recently completed its first apartment building. Can you tell us more about that project and whether you encountered any surprises during construction?

Christian: Absolutely. We're thrilled to have completed our first apartment building. The project went well, and we just finished stacking the last module this past Saturday, which was a significant milestone for us as a company. In just two years, we've gone from an idea to successfully completing our first project, which

 we're very proud of.

As for surprises during construction, I wouldn't say there were any significant surprises. Our team has worked diligently to ensure a smooth construction process, and we've had great collaboration with our partners and contractors. It's been an exciting journey to bring this project to completion.

John: Congratulations on that achievement. It's indeed a significant milestone. I also see that Rise Modular has a new factory, which is approximately 141,000 square feet. Can you tell us more about what you're currently working on and how this new factory benefits your operations?

Christian: Our new factory is a significant asset for Rise Modular. We spent a lot of time searching for the right facility, and we were fortunate to find one that could be retrofitted into a state-of-the-art modular manufacturing plant. The facility is approximately 141,000 square feet, and it's located in Owatonna, Minnesota.

With this new factory, we're well-positioned to execute our projects efficiently. We have the capability to run about a million square feet of production per year once we reach full capacity. Additionally, the facility is designed to be expandable, so we have room for growth in the future.

Currently, we're focused on building multi-family projects, including market-rate, affordable, student housing, senior housing, and permanent supportive housing. While we anticipate that hospitality projects will pick up in the next year or so, our primary focus right now is on multi-family construction.

John: That sounds like an impressive facility and a strategic location. Regarding construction materials, I understand Rise Modular predominantly uses wood framing. Can you explain why you've chosen wood over steel and what advantages you see with wood framing?

Christian: Yes, Rise Modular primarily uses wood framing for our projects. We made this choice based on our market research, which revealed that within a 750-mile radius of our plant, over 85% of units delivered in the multi-family and hospitality sectors were constructed using wood framing. Less than 15% were built with concrete and steel.

Wood construction is generally cost-effective within this market, even though there have been fluctuations in lumber prices. Building with wood allows us to construct buildings of up to five stories over a two-story podium cost-effectively. Therefore, considering the market demand and economics, wood framing is the natural choice for us at this time.

John: It makes sense to align with the existing market conditions. Switching gears a bit, I'd like to ask about affordable housing. What is your perspective on the role of the modular construction industry in addressing affordable housing? How do you envision the industry contributing to this critical issue?

Christian: Affordable housing is a pressing issue nationwide, affecting communities across the country. Technology, including modular construction, can play a significant role in addressing this challenge. Modular construction offers construction cost savings and time efficiencies that can help make affordable housing more achievable.

At Rise Modular, we believe that modular construction can be a key solution to increase the supply of affordable housing. By using construction cost savings derived from modular methods and reducing construction timelines, we can help provide more affordable housing options. We're actively working with affordable developers and non-profit organizations to serve this market and believe that modular construction can play a pivotal role in making affordable housing more accessible.

John: That's an important perspective, and modular construction can certainly contribute to addressing the affordable housing crisis. Shifting back to your region, what's the demand like for modular construction in Minneapolis and the upper Midwest? Does it mirror the strong demand seen on the coasts, particularly for affordable housing?

Christian: The demand for modular construction in Minneapolis and the upper Midwest is robust and significant, mirroring the strong demand seen on the coasts. Affordable housing remains a critical issue in this region as well, and there is substantial demand for multi-family and hospitality projects. Modular construction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for meeting this demand.

While you often hear about California and other coastal regions, the affordable housing issue is a nationwide challenge. The upper Midwest is no exception, and we're committed to addressing this issue by delivering quality modular projects in the region.

John: It's essential to recognize that affordable housing is a challenge that transcends geographic boundaries. Regarding the ongoing pandemic, I've been asking guests on the show how they've been navigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Can you share any strategies or measures that Rise Modular has implemented to keep employees safe and productive during this time?

Christian: Certainly. Safety is a top priority at Rise Modular, and we've implemented robust COVID-19 safety measures both at our plant and headquarters. We follow CDC guidelines and local regulations to ensure the safety of our employees and partners. Some of the measures we've implemented include social distancing, mask requirements, daily temperature checks, and enhanced sanitization protocols.

We're fortunate that, to date, we have not had a positive COVID-19 case within our workforce. We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and will continue to follow our safety plans to protect our employees and partners.

John: It's great to hear that you've been successful in maintaining a safe work environment. Finally, what's the vision for Rise Modular over the next 10 years? Where do you see the company heading in the future?

Christian: Over the next 10 years, we anticipate that modular construction will become more commonplace as a construction methodology across the country, including the Midwest. We aim to play a role in this expansion and growth. There is a substantial demand for modular construction, far exceeding the current capacity of existing plants.

Our long-term vision includes the establishment of multiple modular manufacturing plants across the country to serve different geographic markets. While we're focused on the Midwest currently, we plan to expand our footprint in the future.

However, in the short term, our primary focus is on executing our projects and delivering quality modular construction solutions to our customers. We want to ensure that we provide the best possible service and meet the demands of the market. Once we have successfully executed our projects, we will start planning for geographic expansion.

John: It's an exciting vision for the future, and I'm sure many are eager to see the growth of Rise Modular. Christian, I want to thank you for your time today. This has been a great conversation, and I want to extend my congratulations on completing your first apartment building. Here's to many more successful projects in the future.

Christian: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.

John: My pleasure as well. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!
