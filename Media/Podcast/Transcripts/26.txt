Near Miss in New York: How the Industry Dodged a Bullet & What's Coming Next

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Claudia Granados, founder of New York advocacy firm, The Carnelian Group and Jon Hannah-Spacagna, MBI’s Government Affairs Director. Claudia and Jon are here to catch us up on a very near miss for the industry in New York. Claudia and Jon, thanks for being here.

Claudia Granados

Thank you for having us, John. It's a pleasure.

John McMullen

So, Claudia, before we dive in, tell me about yourself and about how and why you started the Carnelian group.

Claudia Granados

So, I have been working in advocacy for about 15 years, really the career that I chose after college. I have been advocating for policies and doing a lot of coalition building. So, my experience comes from working with various corporate nonprofits throughout the country. About two years ago, right before COVID actually, I decided that I wanted to go out on my own because I wanted to build some new and emerging industries that I can take more time and more in depth, to work with them so that we can educate legislators about the new technologies, industries that are upcoming and how we're shaping the future. When you run your own business, you can pick and choose clients that you want to work with. They’re innovative and develop a little bit more time with them. That's why I decided to go on my own. I started my company last January, two months before the pandemic.

John McMullen

Oh, wow. So, it's very new, very new.

Claudia Granados

Yeah. So, although I've been in New York State, specifically, I have been lobbying up in Albany and in the City for about seven years. Before that I was doing work all over the country. I started my work in California, then moved to DC and went around the country doing political and advocacy work.

John McMullen

So now, of course, you're based in New York.

Claudia Granados

Yes.

John McMullen

So, what's the political environment in New York, particularly in regards to labor and construction? What are the general challenges that you face when you're advocating for a construction or labor related issue?

Claudia Granados

You know, it's very good question. The times have changed a great deal since I started doing this work. I want to say about 10 years ago, I was working for then-mayor Cory Booker here in the city of Newark, New Jersey and my work was a little bit different. I was actually advocating on behalf of the city in trying to work through project labor agreements to make sure we had enough work for everybody. Market rate union work, as well as building affordable housing for institutional housing for groups that are held very difficult to house and really creating a space for everybody to coexist. I would say the changes that I have seen are multifaceted.

One is, we have this changing wave of the politics around the country becoming more polarized. We have a lot, we went through a period where there was a lot of work right there, everybody was coming to work. There was a lot of projects in play after the crash of 2008, or almost crash, and so where a lot of the labor force were very intense and doing a lot of public work, because that was the only place that they could get jobs for the numbers. And because we have a robust economy, everything was going well.

Since the pandemic, I think part of the challenge in working with construction and labor is trying to really, again, create the space with emerging industries like modular construction to come in. Do the work, and scale up, while at the same time maintaining that autonomy to be able to produce the housing or commercial buildings in a factory that oftentimes are not related in the local level. So, a lot of the trade. One to go and push a lot of the legislators and say, well, everything has to be done locally.

Well, that's not always the case. When you have a housing crisis, the way that we do now, which is very acute here in New York and in California specifically, we have to find new models, new ways of doing business. So, part of what I see of the challenge is trying to make sure that the people that we're advocating to the legislators understand that in order for us to build and be part of a solution to build more affordable housing, transitional housing, to deal with the current crises, we have to be able to create a space for modular construction to flourish. So that often means, yes, we're going to have work that is located in different states and that is done in a factory. That's where we didn't do cost savings. It doesn't mean that labor is shut out of it.

So, part of this is trying to position ourselves so that they understand that we're not taking their work, because in many places like New York and California, because of a union density vary, we'll be able to still have some of the work. I think that's the biggest challenge.

John McMullen

So, Jon, I'm going to turn to you, what can you tell us about this specific issue that MBI has been dealing with in New York and what is MBI trying to accomplish?
