The Evolution and Future of Modular Showers w/ Roman Ltd.

John McMullen

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.
Hello, and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. I'm talking with David Osborne, CEO of UK-based Roman Showers. David is here to talk about the evolution of modular showers and current trends within the industry.

David, thanks for calling in.

David Osborne

Thanks for having me. Nice to be here.

John McMullen

So, tell me about yourself David. How did you end up as CEO at Roman?

David Osborne

Well, my father actually started the business in 1985. So, I joined straight from university in 1992. So, I was thrust straight into it. It's been a bit of a marvelous 29 years now. So, we’re very excited. The business has transformed and we're in a very good place now.

John McMullen

Well, that's good. That's great to hear. For those who aren't familiar, tell me more about Roman Showers itself. Where exactly are you guys based and how did the company get started?

David Osborne

Well, we were based up in County Durham in northeast England. So, we're really not that far from Scotland. Originally, the business started from scratch and if you think back to the 80s, the original idea was actually different color printing onto glass. Then it was matching with the different bathroom colors at the time that we seem to have moved on from that, but they were all the different greens and browns and whatever. So that's where we started from. Now we're three factories up in the northeast. So, we're a 400,000 square feet site. We manufacture shower enclosures, solid surface, moldings, sinks and basins. Then really, we have a solid service fabrication plant, which is doing vanity tops, etc. We have a subsidiary business over in Ireland in Dublin, which is a sales and marketing operation. Then very important, we have a base over in Malaysia, which manufactures over there for the Asia Pacific market, we don't bring anything outside Asia Summit, that's quite a unique thing. Now within all of our products and commodities are coming from Southeast Asia, we're actually manufacturing there for, the Asian Pacific market.

We've got two very important architectural showrooms. One is in London, and one is in Kuala Lumper, which are really both some key architectural hubs. Now we're very much the UK’s and Europe's largest manufacturer, and we supply around the world. We have a joint venture aluminum business in Malaysia as well. But we're very capability led, and especially within really what's cool to you is simply this is the specification hospitality sector and that's really where international business goes. I think the easy summary is capability travels.

John McMullen

That’s quite a bit of growth. That's really outstanding. As we touched on, Roman has been around for close to 40 years now. What have you noticed about the modular shower industry over that span of time? How has the industry evolved?

David Osborne 

Well, I think when we first had initial dealings with the modular industry it was very much more perceived as a simple level entry offer. In the last 15, particularly the last 10 years, the profile of modular building has just soared. Some of the most prestigious residential jobs, all the top international hotels, are now comfortably using modular construction. It takes some variables out, it makes it very international, and we deal with modular companies now all over Europe. Dubai, Middle East, Malaysia, China. Of course, the end destinations can be anywhere. So really, we're seeing a very large growth in the whole modular industry.

John McMullen

So, tell me more about the way you've seen design professionals, architects and other designers change how they've utilized modular showers and other prefab elements.

David Osborne

I suppose in our experience, as modular has become more mainstream, as designers, architects are more relaxed, and understanding what to build we're seeing much more synergy, I suppose now between the desired outcome for the bathroom and the structural constraints and what it will build. So, it's really more integrated now. I think moreover, designers actually now embrace and understand the full benefits of the simplifications that modular building gives them and not only importantly, understand the ongoing service and maintenance benefits and requirements, etc. So, I think that's changed dramatically.

John McMullen

So, you mentioned synergy. How is that synergy and the evolution that we're talking about affected the way that these products are designed and produced?

David Osborne

Well, I suppose in our case, we are a little different in what we do. I mean, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we were simply being asked for a glass shower, showering, area, enclosure, whatever. Now, we've spread to become really producing integrated sharing areas, with vanity tops, bathroom furniture integrated. So, we're significantly speeding up and controlling the installation process as a result. I think very importantly, we're eliminating many of the onsite variables and pre plumbing first fixes can be built in, etc. The huge impact is in integration. We're working with Korey and a lot of other solid surface brands and just building the bathroom structure rather than just a showering area. That’s probably the biggest change.

John McMullen

How do your designers and engineers work? What's the process for creating a new model of a modular shower?

David Osborne

Well, our design team, are used to working in every way imaginable really, with a huge array of different clients and no two are really the same. Sometimes we send visual concepts for the bathroom, and we literally have to break it down into sections and then redesign it really for manufacturer and installation, really break it down itself into modular pieces. Sometimes we receive drawings for really specific requirements onsite. Other times, I suppose we might require the layout to be redesigned, to see what the what the ultimate design goal is. Working as opposed to make sure we keep all the different stakeholders. So, the designers’ clients, the modular partners involved at every stage of that. I don't have the time now. So, the architects or clients are actually asking us to recommend the modular manufacturer, as a sector might be new to them. This is where the development of strong partnerships comes in. We aren't just on the specification, but we're also bringing in and recommending excellent modular manufacturers as partners.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, speaking of manufacturers, if I'm a manufacturer looking to include modular showers in my next project, at what point in the process should I be contacting you? What options do I have?

David Osborne

Well, without questions, ideally at the very start. I mean our products and a variety of installation systems are actually a bit more complicated than they might seem. So, we can talk about installation fixing methods, we'd rather the layout be designed right the first time, obviously. In reality, we don't get involved that many times at the initial stage. Most commonly, a lot of the design work is already done and we're suggesting finishes, some specialist insulation sealing systems. Of course, sometimes we're parachuted near the end of the program, due to someone else's failure, rejection by the client, whatever it might be. But the great thing for us by being a fully integrated manufacturer and designer is, that we might be faced with quite a complicated, specialized bespoke sharing system, integrated top space in sink furniture, and that needs to be installed pretty much anywhere in the world in two weeks. And nobody can do that. That's really what sets us apart in terms of capability. A huge choice of solid surface finishes. Now as you've probably gathered from basic solid colors into marble effects, even translucent materials and things, really, it's a huge design choice.

John McMullen

I read on your website that your products are currently in 52 different countries, which is pretty amazing. What differences have you noticed in the various international markets in which you operate?

David Osborne

I think our website needs a big update actually it’s 63 at the moment. I think with some close relationships, and we work very closely with the main international hotel groups. So, the number is growing all the time in terms of where we've been spreading and developing into new markets. I suppose the most fundamental difference we find is a lot of the developing markets have the sharing area which is stills of left on a on a glass contract a specification rather than being bathrooms specification. So that one that always needs to be changed and evolved relatively quickly. Essentially, we're the only party that moves in the bathroom once it's installed if you think about it. We also then have to act as a giant fish tank. So, some clients can be very particular and precious about the sink. But you know, once that’s screwed into the wall that never moves. So, a lot of the time our key products don't get the design airtime they actually deserve in reality. I think once modular partners get to understand the benefits you get from working with it as an international specialist branded product, it becomes a very different story in terms of how you manage that dynamic.

John McMullen

So, what specifically have you noticed about the design trends over the past few years? You mentioned earlier, back in the 80s, it was greens and browns. I think we're all thankful we've left those behind largely, but how have the trends changed in the past few years and how have those trends impacted you?

David Osborne

I think we’re all glad we left those colors behind. I think the major trend is to move away from chrome fittings and clear glass. In the project market, we offer fifteen specialist color finishes for aluminum and brass. Our manufacturing capability really allows us to offer pretty much any specialist finishes beyond these as long as there's a volume to justify it. We've seen things like matte black, bush nickel, matte white really emerging strongly. That’s a metal trend.

Glass has consistently gotten thicker, heavier, which is very much perception driven rather than performance, but you can't change that. Then we've also seen some industrial look, blacks and crittall style finishes coming in and a really big change is now this retro style of fluted glass coming back into a fashion now and integrative anti tops. Really, that's more of an overall design integration trend where integrative anti tops with showers are the biggest evolution for us as a business in hospitality. It's not just for design, it actually eliminates a real problem, which is the gap between the basin and the shower door that you can't see or clean. The studies are made on proper problem for hotels around the world. It also simplifies installation. I mean, you literally can't fit it wrong. It has to go together in a particular way. We see furniture, shelving, drawers all coming and being integrated as well.

One thing we've developed, which is a big factor for modular industry and people having to then give warranties, etc. In the last five years we've developed a silicon free wall fixing system. So, frames and colors become minimal, in fact, a premium, you don't want to install a covering the framing two inches of silicon. So, when we have a type system that's actually between the glass and the profile and the profile and the wall, so it acts as a as a seal from the inside. So, there's nothing visible, completely watertight, but it's maintenance free and that's obviously a big benefit to everyone in the supply chain.

John McMullen

Absolutely. Are there any other different design trends for showers in different parts of the world or are they all fairly similar?

David Osborne

No. I think due to the nature of the international hotel groups, there is a lot of similarity, but I mean, certainly we pick out a few things. I mean, Asia Pacific was always the one driving wet room design and the double AXA showring and that's really become a global trend now. Not just to design but also the aging population, arthritis, etc. an integration of antitoxin, showers, I mean everyone sort of seems to think they will have the same problems with installers it's everywhere. So, what you can control through modular build and the way we do things is really giving that that sort of guarantee. Middle East is always keen on full height, ceiling fixings for like showers and integrating toilet cubicles next to the showers, etc. I'm sure the US has got some different metal finishes to Europe as well, but these are all very easily solvable. Those ones are in a pretty small place now in terms of design.

John McMullen

Can you make any guesses about the next five years? Are there any emerging trends that you're just picking up on?

David Osborne

Well, I think there is one, whether it's some trend, or it's certainly the reaction to the whole COVID thing we've had, but in Europe the vast majority of our competitors are of Chinese oriented or using Chinese origin product. With this supply chain, disruption pops over dependency on Chinese manufacturing. We're seeing that changing quite quickly and, I think we're doing a carbon zero program at the moment here as a cost level business. And sustainability is only getting home. Everyone's agenda and particularly the main international hotel groups are really focused on that now.

So, we have some as a business here at Roman, we have some amazingly high environmental stats and stories and really embracing the circular economy. That’s really the key thing for the future. We think there are key principles in our process, and it's becoming more and more of a differential rather than just being a valid thing to do. This is washing down from hotels and hospitality into major residential, ultimately, of course, retail, but consumers are more and more environmentally aware. I suppose we must make sure we use a significant environmental impact vantage, counter every stage really whether sector that's in.

John McMullen

So, I'll bring us up bring us full circle you started the show telling us about the growth of Roman Showers. What's next? Where are you guys going from here?

David Osborne

Very bluntly: To the USA, if you want a genuine answer. We’ve been doubling for a few years in the USA and Canada, and we want to do it properly. We aim to be working very hard with all the major hotel groups, we are, but really into the USA and design, manufacturing, environmental strengths really come to the fore in that. So, we are going to be building some significant long-term partnerships in the next few years. That's entirely based having looked at what's going on, it's entirely based on hospitality sector. That's our international differential.

So, its capability around hotel hospitality modular design. So, say we're dealing with groups. We've been over to your conference a few years ago in Tucson. We'll be you'll see us at quite a few hotel exhibitions, and we already know quite a lot of people. So yeah, bluntly. That's pretty much our stated aim in the next five years.

John McMullen

Well, very good. I wish you luck. Thank you, David, for your time today. I really appreciate it. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.
