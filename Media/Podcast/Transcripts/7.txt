Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Jim Dunn, President and Founder of Stack Modular. Jim is here to talk about steel-frame modular buildings and to catch us up on Stack's recent projects. Jim, how are you today?

[Jim]
I'm pretty darn good, John. Thanks for having me.

[John]
It's my pleasure. So, let's jump right in. Tell me about Stack Modular. How did the company get started, and where do you operate?

[Jim]
Sure. About 12 or 13 years ago, I was a low-rung engineer in California, and I met a young lady who said that China is the future. I ventured over to China, and while that relationship didn't last, the business did. I started Stack Modular, and we primarily operate in Canada and Asia.

[John]
That's quite a journey. Now, you mentioned that Stack Modular builds with steel. Why is that?

[Jim]
We've always found steel to be a suitable material for our modular buildings. In China, we didn't have an abundance of timber or wood, so steel was the natural choice. Additionally, steel offers several advantages, including durability, high seismic resistance, design flexibility, fire resistance, and less warping and mold issues compared to wood. Steel is also better suited for transportation over long distances, which is important for us, given our operations between China and North America.

[John]
It makes sense. Steel certainly has its advantages. What's the main difference between steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular construction? Are there other differences beyond the ones you've mentioned?

[Jim]
Certainly. While steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular share many similarities, there are some key differences. Steel-frame modular buildings are typically designed for greater heights than wood-frame structures. They offer more design flexibility because steel has a higher strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for less structural intrusion into room layouts. Steel is fire-resistant, making it a safer choice in terms of fire protection. Steel modules are also less susceptible to warping and mold issues, which can be problematic with wood. Additionally, steel-frame modular buildings tend to be more durable and have a longer lifespan.

[John]
Those are some significant advantages. Now, you recently worked on a project in California that combined steel-frame modules with site-built components. Can you tell us more about that project and how it worked?

[Jim]
Certainly. In California, we're working on a hybrid project that combines steel-frame modular units with site-built components. In this project, the first three stories of the building are site-built using concrete construction. Above those three levels, we stack the steel-frame modular units. This approach allows us to take advantage of the speed and efficiency of modular construction while accommodating specific site requirements and building needs.

[John]
That sounds like an interesting approach. What's the installation process like for a project like this, where you have a combination of site-built and modular components? Are there any special considerations?

[Jim]
The installation process for a hybrid project like this involves several steps. First, the site-built components, such as the concrete foundation and the first three stories of the building, are constructed on-site. Simultaneously, in our factory, we build the steel-frame modular units that will be stacked on top of the site-built portion.

Once the modules are complete and have passed quality checks, they are transported to the project site. The modules are then lifted into place by cranes and stacked on top of the site-built structure. On-site, the teams work on connecting MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) systems vertically, tying them into the corridor system. The corridors and finishing work are typically completed on-site.

The key to a successful project like this is coordination between the various teams, including architects, engineers, the modular provider, and the construction crew. Communication and alignment between all parties are critical to ensure that the modules align seamlessly with the site-built components.

[John]
I can imagine that coordination is essential for a project like this. Speaking of coordination, how does the design process work for a hybrid modular project? Are there any special considerations for architects and engineers?

[Jim]
The design process for a hybrid modular project begins with early collaboration between the modular provider, architects, engineers, and the project's ownership group. It's crucial to involve the modular team from the early sketch stages of the project to ensure that the design accommodates modular construction efficiently.

Architects and engineers need to keep modular construction principles in mind while designing the building. This includes understanding module dimensions, structural considerations, and the need for vertical and horizontal connections between modules. Open-mindedness and a willingness to adapt to modular design principles are essential for a successful project.

Ultimately, the goal is to design with modular construction in mind, optimizing the benefits of both site-built and modular components.

[John]
That makes sense. Are there any special considerations or challenges for the on-site team when working with a hybrid modular project like this?

[Jim]
Yes, there can be challenges for the on-site team when working on a hybrid modular project. One significant consideration is the coordination between the on-site construction crew and the modular provider. Both teams need to work together seamlessly to ensure that the modules fit precisely onto the site-built components.

There may also be differences in the finishing work required for the site-built and modular portions of the building. While modular units are typically 98% complete in terms of interior finishes, some finishing work is still needed on-site, especially in common areas like corridors.

In general, the on-site team needs to adapt to the unique requirements of a hybrid modular project, ensuring that all components align correctly and that MEP systems are integrated smoothly.

[John]
I can see how that coordination and adaptation are essential for a successful project. Do you see hybrid structures like this becoming more common as modular construction gains popularity?

[Jim]
Absolutely. Hybrid structures offer a practical solution for many construction projects. While modular construction is known for its speed and efficiency, there will always be site-specific requirements and design considerations that are best addressed through traditional site-built construction. Hybrid modular projects allow for the best of both worlds, combining the benefits of modular and site-built components. As modular construction continues to gain popularity, we can expect to see more hybrid projects that leverage the strengths of both approaches.

[John]
That's a great perspective. So, what's next for Stack Modular? Do you have any exciting projects or developments on the horizon?

[Jim]
Our focus is on continuing to deliver high-quality modular solutions while adapting to changing circumstances. One of our primary challenges right now is navigating the complexities of international trade and regulations, especially between China and North America. We want to ensure that our clients are protected and that we can continue to provide efficient modular solutions for housing and building needs.

As for exciting projects, who knows what the future holds? We're always looking for opportunities to push the boundaries of modular construction. We could see ourselves working on even

 taller and more complex projects in the coming years, including potentially 40 or 50-story structures right here in North America.

[John]
That's ambitious and exciting. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Stack Modular. Thanks so much for joining us today, Jim. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.

[Jim]
Thank you, John. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to a future with exciting modular projects.
