Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by RC Alley, partner at AO Architects in Los Angeles. RC is here to talk about designing for modular construction, and in particular, how modular buildings are a perfect solution for the nation's affordable housing dilemma. RC, thanks for being on today.

RC: Thank you, John, for inviting me. 

John: Tell me about yourself, RC. What got you interested in architecture, and how long have you been designing?

RC: I'm a second-generation architect. My father practiced in Chicago, where he worked for Mies van der Rohe. So, I was always around architecture, even though they moved to New Mexico, which is where I was born and raised. I've always been around architecture, particularly around more contemporary, mid-century modern buildings. So, it was just something that was ingrained in me from the get-go. I would say I also have that's kind of what my ingrained skills are; my skill sets are. I don't know if I could do anything other than being an architect. That's just because that's how I'm wired.

John: Gotcha. So, tell me about AO. You're based just outside of Los Angeles, is that right?

RC: Yes, we're actually in Orange County, which is about 30 miles south of Los Angeles. We have been around; the firm was founded in 1974 by my partner, Jack Selman. He's still the senior partner here. Initially, it started as a retail firm, and as it grew, we added disciplines. It went from retail, and they started doing industrial work, started doing larger retail projects. We do factory outlet center work all around the world now. We're about 270 people in size, and we are the largest firm in Orange County. Of the 270 people, about 130 of them are in my team, which is the multi-family and mixed-use team. We're very busy. My team started with me; I had been here working for the retail division. I left; I came here in 1989. I left for a couple of years, and I came back. I went to a firm where I learned multi-family, and I came back here to do one apartment project. So, the multi-family division at that time was me; I would design them, I would do the drawings on them, and I would do the fieldwork on them. As we continued to grow and evolved as a firm, but even as a group, my whole team evolved. So now, we do work all over the western US. That's what my team does because we like to limit our travel time. But I have partners that do work all around the world.

John: That's quite a bit of growth. That's impressive. So, has AO been designing modular buildings for a long time, or is that a relatively new avenue for you?

RC: It's something that we've been keenly interested in, in particular, between the multi-family team and our hospitality team for more than 10 years. It's been part of our think tank efforts. I'd say 10 years or more, we've been interested in it. But our first project that solidified was about six years ago on the hospitality side, where we built a project in Hawthorne, which is just south of LA. The other thing that's interesting with working with him is he's very passionate about it, to the point where he has built his own modular factory now, AutoBox, up in Idaho. So, we've had a lot of opportunity to be very involved in developing the systems and the design parameters that are coming out of this factory right now.

John: Cool. Well, he sounds like a great future guest. I'll have to find a way to track him down.

RC: I think he would be a good one for you. 

John: Thank you. What are the advantages you see in designing for modular construction?

RC: There are a bunch of them. A lot of them have to do with speed, speed to market, weather conditions. If you're building in an environment that has a short duration for the summer months, like maybe Idaho, for instance. But we're really seeing them on the affordable project. If there are labor challenges with labor constraints in the market, it really helps alleviate some of those challenges. So, we're very optimistic about the continued evolution and acceptance of modular projects in the market.

John: For those unfamiliar, is designing for modular much different than designing for traditional buildings?

RC: Absolutely. It's very, very different. I would say, first of all, it takes a very disciplined approach to really design it. You have to really understand the technology behind the product. You have to understand if you're doing... You have to understand what the constraints are in the factory in terms of length. You have to understand all the challenges with transporting the modules, how the buildings are assembled. It really requires a commitment to it. If you're going to do a modular project, first of all, you need to understand it, which means you need to walk some projects. You need to go to the factory and understand what those are about and understand even some of the utilitarian aspects of it. But you have to be committed to it. If you're doing a podium project, of course, that's field-built. The podium component has to be built in the field, but everything above it can be modular. So, if you're going to do it, I tell clients, if you're going to do a modular project, you have to be committed to do it fully. You can't do it partially modular and partially field-built, especially in the areas that it could actually be built in a factory.

John: I'm going to switch gears on you just a little bit. I know affordable housing is a big interest of yours. What can you tell me about the housing situation in LA?

RC: Boy, that's a good question. LA is its own animal, of course. Right now, there's about, if you read any of the information, there's a housing shortage in LA of 400,000 to 500,000 units. There's a significant challenge with homelessness and a need for housing in general. There's a big demand there, and there's also a large desire to do housing in LA, but it's just challenging. It's in California. Some things that have occurred over the last year or several years have really helped push housing projects forward, especially affordable housing, which is what a lot of our modular projects are. The Senate Bill SB 1818, which is the state density bonus law, the Senate Bill 330, which is the Housing Crisis Act of 2019, there's a Senate Bill... I'm sorry, Assembly Bill 2345, which is to

 promote affordable housing. So, all these bills have been passed, which have made it a little bit easier to do these types of projects, which is great.

John: In what ways do you see modular construction as a solution to this housing crisis in Los Angeles?

RC: In particular, when we're doing modular, we do it for the affordable projects for the most part. Some of the affordable projects that we've done, which are all located in the city of LA or in the county, they have committed to do these. The city is trying to meet their objectives of providing housing, especially affordable housing, and they're committed to doing it. So, it's very refreshing for us. There's an extensive commitment to trying to bring the cost down and to trying to get units out there as quickly as possible. So, we've had projects that we've done, which have been very challenging in terms of budget. But the city has really committed to doing whatever they can to make the project pencil out. So, it's refreshing for us. 

John: You mentioned SB 1818 and AB 2345. How do those work in tandem with modular construction projects to make it easier to get affordable housing built?

RC: They don't necessarily make it easier to get it built, but they make it easier to get it financed. For instance, under 2345, for instance, there's one provision that's great. It allows for... As we know, there's always a concern with parking and the requirement to provide parking in a project. Well, 2345 actually allows for a 100% reduction in parking requirements. So, that means you can build more units on the site. So, that's a great benefit. So, we're seeing more of the reduction of the parking spaces. And what we're trying to do on all our projects is to get a really high percentage of two-bedroom and three-bedroom units because there's a tremendous need for it. That's also something that's required by the state density bonus law.

So, 2345... And this is the thing with 2345, is there's always been a requirement that there's a 15% affordable requirement on projects, which is great. That's always been in place for a while. The problem is there was no differentiation between levels of affordability. Now there's a requirement that out of that 15% affordable requirement, there has to be a component of that which is at 30% of median income. That's very, very difficult to do because there's no money in that. So, it's a challenge. But at the end of the day, all these things are tools to help make the project more feasible. In terms of the density bonus, if you're doing a 100% affordable project, you're allowed a 50% increase in density on the site, which is huge. That's one of the provisions of that. That helps make projects more feasible because that's also something that you can then take to a bank and get it financed.

John: Let's talk a little bit about density. You mentioned the density bonus law. One of the arguments I hear against modular construction is that it's not as efficient in terms of land use because you have to transport these larger modules to the site. What's your response to that?

RC: I don't know if that's necessarily true because there's still a requirement for you to provide all the parking spaces on the site. So, if you're building an apartment project, a four-story apartment project on a small site, you're required to have a specific number of parking spaces. It's not as though you're getting a 100% reduction in the parking spaces. It's not like in New York City where there's a big push for... Or in San Francisco, where they're reducing the parking requirements significantly. It's not like that in LA. So, I don't know if it's more land-efficient, but it's certainly more efficient in terms of building the building because we're able to do that in a much shorter duration. The four-story podium that I mentioned earlier, for instance, we're doing one in San Pedro. It's 180 units. It's 800 modules. That would have taken a year and a half to two years to build in the field. But we're doing it in four months.

So, what that does is it makes the project that much more feasible, especially for a developer that has an equity partner or that has debt on the project. You're paying your interest on your debt much sooner because you're in and out of that project so much quicker. So, that makes a huge difference. The time you're saving is probably 25% to 30% of the schedule. So, on a project, you're probably saving six months on a project that would normally take two years to build. So, that's huge.

John: Do you have any advice for architects who might be considering getting into modular design?

RC: Yes, I would say that it's not for the faint of heart. It's not something that you can dabble in. You have to really be committed to doing it. It is a new technology. It's been around for a while, but it's still not something that's been embraced by the market. But I do see that happening. I've been committed to doing this for 10 years, but I see it happening. I see the push for it happening. I think with all these bills, the city and the county, they're committed to making it happen. I think that in 10 years, it's going to be a very large percentage of the multi-family market. So, if you're interested in doing that, you have to learn about it, which means you have to go out and do some site visits. You have to get to know the fabricators. You have to get to know the technology behind it, which is like anything else. But again, I'll say, if you're going to do it, you have to be committed to it.

John: Great advice. Well, that's all I have for you today, RC. Thank you for joining me and sharing your insights on modular construction and affordable housing.

RC: Thank you, John. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about modular.
