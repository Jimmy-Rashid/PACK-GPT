Introduction:
Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by John Hanis-Bacani, MBI's Government Affairs Director. John's here today to catch us all up on MBI's efforts to support modular construction around the country. John, thanks for being on today. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.

Tell Me About Yourself:
So, tell me about yourself. What's your background?
John Hanis-Bacani: Prior to coming to MBI, I spent about 21 years in the government affairs industry, working for a Fortune 30 company in corporate law. I managed the local, state, and federal government affairs for the Mid-Atlantic region. So, I have a long history of working in that environment and trying to do what's best to make sure the industry that we're in has the ability to excel.

What Is the Importance of Government Affairs?
John McMullen: Excellent. So, generally speaking, what's the importance of government affairs here at MBI?
John Hanis-Bacani: Here at MBI, it's kind of two facets. One is making sure that we take care of issues that arise with our members, which will always be a priority for us. Such as delays in plan approval, working with code officials, and maybe misinterpreting the codes. Just making sure that we have relationships with those code officials and those regulatory entities. So, when our members do have an issue, we're able to step in and be that mediator to resolve the problem as quickly as we can.

What's Been Going On in New York?
John McMullen: Gotcha. I know you're doing a lot of work internally. Tell me about MBI's Government Affairs Committee, which you chair here as a staff member. Who's on that, and what purpose does it serve?
John Hanis-Bacani: So, we have 17 committee members from all parts of the industry, whether it's relocatable, permanent modular construction. They serve as a sounding board for us to discuss ideas that we may want to explore, such as being proactive in removing barriers in the marketplace or opening up more opportunities for our industry.

COVID-19 Impact on MBI:
John McMullen: So, get me caught up. What's been going on? Well, you know, as you know, with the year we've had in 2020, COVID-19 was certainly front and center. Fortunately for us, we had some things in place that we put together prior to COVID-19 hitting that really helped us promote our industry during the pandemic and what our industry was able to offer. Part of that was with our phone-to-action system that allowed members to reach over 300 local, city, state, and federal officials directly and involve them. Also, our partnership with the National Governors Association allowed us to reach out to literally every governor and provincial premier to let them know what our industry was able to do and steer them to our crisis response page.

Crisis Response Page:
John McMullen: Very nice. That's really given us a government affairs reach almost across North America, all the U.S., Canada, dealing with issues for a lot of our members. What else has been going on? I know there's a lot happening in New York. Is that right?
John Hanis-Bacani: Yes. We're very fortunate this year that we hired an actual New York lobbyist to be on the ground in Albany to make sure that we were protecting the industry in a state that is very highly regulated. What we were able to accomplish this year was there were three bills presented, one from Mayor de Blasio in New York City, all of which would have prevented the industry from doing business as usual. They would have required using union workers on any projects in New York and brought in the prevailing wage issue. During the extended session when they came back, we were able to prevent all three of those bills from being brought to the floor for a vote. We continue to work with our lobbyists as we prepare for the election to see if those bill sponsors are re-elected. If so, we'll be prepared to take steps to defeat them again in the next session if needed.

DC:
John McMullen: Gotcha. Speaking of lobbying firms, I know we have one in D.C., correct?
John Hanis-Bacani: We have a D.C. lobbying firm that's done a great job for us. They help us not only meet with members of Congress but also develop relationships with leadership at FEMA and HUD. They're working on the ground to support issues like the Payroll Protection Plan, and we're working with them to make sure they're focused on efforts directly impacting our industry.

CMHC:
John McMullen: Speaking of federal stuff, I know we work a lot with our Canadian friends, CMHC. We've made a lot of progress with them lately. Can you tell me about that?
John Hanis-Bacani: Absolutely. When I came on board in 2018, CMHC wouldn't even finance any modular projects. So, we first removed that restriction to make sure they would finance them. Then we found out they needed more guidance on financing modular projects. We shared guidelines with CMHC that were developed in collaboration with NIBS (National Institute of Building Sciences) and Fannie Mae. CMHC plans to adopt these guidelines for financing modular projects.

Town Halls:
John McMullen: So, we have a committee, we have you on the ground, we have lobbying firms doing workforce. Tell me about the town hall calls that you host throughout the year. What purpose do they serve, and what gets accomplished through those?
John Hanis-Bacani: This year, we've had five town hall calls in New York, Arizona, Massachusetts, California, and Texas. These calls help us build relationships with those regulating our industry and give our members an opportunity to have a voice directly with leadership and inspectors they work with. They can discuss issues like delays in plan review, guidelines, and work collaboratively to find solutions. For example, we passed a law in Texas that removed a four-story height restriction on modular construction and worked with the department to make sure they had time to implement it. These town halls are invaluable for our industry and members.

Richie Torres:
John McMullen: Speaking of relationships, there's a future congressman coming into New York, Richie Torres, I believe his name is. So, you've reached out to him, and we've got a meeting scheduled or a call?
John Hanis-Bacani: Yes, we have a call today with Richie Torres and his chief of staff. Mr. Torres is soon to be elected, coming out of the Bronx district. He's passionate about affordable housing and making sure he's doing the best for his constituency. He's shown interest in our industry's ability to build faster, more efficiently, with less waste.

 We plan to have a Zoom call today and set up a tour for him to visit one of our member facilities and meet with one of our board members to see modular construction in action.

Seals Program:
John McMullen: Very exciting. One last thing I wanted to touch on, since your role here touches the whole membership, there's a way for the membership to support you through our SEALS program. Can you tell me about the SEALS program, what it is, and how it helps us?
John Hanis-Bacani: The SEALS program has been around for a long time, and it involves each member committing to buy a seal for every module they build. A hundred percent of that income goes to supporting our government affairs efforts. These funds have allowed us to hire lobbyists in D.C. and New York City, join the National Governors Association, and do the work needed to protect the industry, remove barriers, and open up opportunities. The SEALS program is crucial for our efforts.

Outro:
John McMullen: Well, thanks so much, John. I know government affairs is one of the most important services MBI offers, and it's been great to get caught up on everything that's been going on. We should definitely do this again.
John Hanis-Bacani: Thanks, John. I appreciate it.
John McMullen: My name is John McMullen. This has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.
