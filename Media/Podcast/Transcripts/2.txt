Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. My name is John McMullen, I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI, and today I'm joined by Landon Boucher and Sean Lothrop of Innovative Structural Engineering. They're here today to talk about the ins and outs of structural engineering for modular buildings. Landon and Sean, how are you doing today?

Great, great. How are you today?

I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. So, in a nutshell, let's kick this thing off. In a nutshell, what is structural engineering?

Yeah, thanks, John. This is Landon, so I mean really, in a nutshell, structural engineering is a little bit of an art and a science, probably more science than it is art, but it's a portion of the design that involves what are typically the unseen elements of the building, the structural shell or what is sometimes referred to as the bones of a building. And I say that it's a little bit of an art because there's solutions that we can come up with, right? But that we know as a, just from our own perspective as structural engineers, but we're working on a project with a whole team of people, and there's different needs and understandings that each person on that team brings to the table. And so sometimes the art is involved with the creativity and coming up with a solution that fits everybody.

Hey, John, this is Sean. To add to that a little bit too, on a more technical side, we're actually designing the building to meet two specific types of loading, so basically gravity loading, making sure the building isn't gonna fall down due to gravity, and looking at that. And then we're also looking to provide a lateral system design, so if your building is hit with large wind loads or large amounts of seismic load, the building isn't gonna fail in that manner and stay standing. So yeah, that's kind of a summary.

Gotcha, thank you. Landon, you mentioned that there's a team at work here, so what is the structural engineer's role in the project? Where do you fit in?

That's a great question. You know, and so I'm gonna have Sean expand on this a little bit, but you know, we get asked that question, you know, from time to time, and I always phrase it, and really it comes down to three parts, really. Number one, it's to listen. That's how it starts off where we want to listen, understand the customer's objectives for that project. Number two, we want to present the options right on how to achieve those objectives. And then number three, we want to coordinate effectively to ensure the desired outcome for whatever project it is that we're working on at that moment. But, you know, specifically when it comes to sort of the nuts and bolts, if you will, for what our role is, I think I'd like Sean to expand on that a little bit.

Yeah, no, thank you. So we're basically creating, if it's a wood structure, we're creating a wood framing plan to show how to build the structure. You know, at the foundation level, we're creating a foundation plan that shows how thick the concrete should be, where the rebar should be located, where the anchor embed should be. So we're basically creating a plan set and then a calculation set to go along with it to submit to the jurisdictions that allow the, it gives a guideline for the builder to know how to put the structure together to be able to resist certain types of loading. So yeah, that's kind of the summary.

Thanks, Sean. I got another question for you. What process do you use when you're working on a modular project? Is it any different than you would normally use? Do you use specific software, specific strategies when you design for modular?

So, realistically, the process of designing a modular building is very similar to a traditional site-built structure. As far as the structural engineer's view into the project, the way we approach it is very similar to the traditional. Maybe what some people don't understand is that there's a factory component and then there's a site component to this type of building. You may have, we may have a different architect on a portion of the building, but for the most part, there's usually one factory, one architect, and we're working with those two groups to get everything done. But our number one customer is the person that we've contracted with on a project. And so it really varies from project to project, but the two key people that we're going to be interacting with the most in general is going to be the architect and the factory. We're still going to be interfacing with all the other sub-consultants and the even the site construction teams, all of that. But the two main are going to be the architect and the factory.

That's correct. I think there's also a modular specific software that we do use a little bit. I think the listeners would be interested in learning about. Landon, you want to touch on that a little bit?

Sure. Yeah, Sean. So there's a few software programs that we use that are a little more modular specific. There's one called Revit. And that's a program where it's a building information modeling program, right? So what that allows us to do is to create a 3D model of the project, right? And then we can tag each element and we can pull from that model certain schedules and information. So we can see how many windows are in a project. We can see what the square footage of the flooring is. We can pull out all of those quantities. Now, we don't necessarily design in that, but it's more like a checking tool or a management tool. So we have the structural drawings, but we can go back and check them within the model, make sure that we're all coordinated and everything fits and that our structural members aren't clashing with the mechanical members or the electrical members or whatever it might be.

Thank you for sharing that. That's really interesting. So when you're designing for modular, are there any unique challenges or considerations that you have to take into account compared to traditional construction?

Yeah, this is Sean. I think probably the biggest one that comes to mind for me is transportation. We're having to make sure that this building is gonna be able to be transported on the road. So you have a lot more factors that come into play when you're looking at the, especially the foundation and the sizes of the modules themselves. So you need to make sure that you're able to have a crane large enough to set these modules. You need to make sure that the trucking route, I guess, allows for the wide loads and tall loads. And so that's a big thing that comes to play that isn't necessarily a huge deal with traditional construction. So yeah, that's one thing that comes to mind for me.

Yeah, that's absolutely true. And I would just add that the transportation aspect and just the module's length and width and height being limited by what can be transported on the road, that can have some implications for the structural design as well. So you have to be mindful of those constraints when you're designing the structural system for the building.

Absolutely. And what about in terms of seismic or wind loads, are there any unique considerations when it comes to modular construction for those kinds of loads?

Yeah, John, I think there's a couple of things that are unique when it comes to that. So from a seismic perspective, there's kind of two different categories that we look at when it comes to seismic. You have your seismic design for the module in the factory, and then you have your seismic design for the module when it's actually on site and connected to the foundation, right? So there's a lot of dynamic stuff that happens when you have an actual building, right? It's gonna have vibrations from the wind, from the occupants, from the equipment. There's gonna be a lot of different vibration sources in a building. And so when you're looking at the seismic design in the factory, you can kind of try to design around those to make sure that your building's gonna be able to stand up to the wind and the seismic as much as you can. But then when you're on site, there's a lot of stuff that you just can't predict. So it's important to make sure that the foundation is designed for seismic loading, and it's also important to make sure that the anchorage from the module to the foundation is designed for seismic loading as well.

And John, one more thing on that too is that typically, especially on the West Coast, in California, we have a lot of different seismic zones. And so what may work in one part of California might not work in another part of California. And so you really have to kind of look at the specific jurisdiction and what the site-specific requirements are and the seismic zones and really kind of design to that specific site.

That's a great point. Modular construction is often touted as being faster and more efficient than traditional construction. How does this affect the structural engineering process and what kind of benefits does it bring?

So, John, I'll start with that one. You know, from a structural engineering perspective, I think one of the benefits that we're seeing with modular construction is that, you know, the buildings are designed to be efficient in the factory, right? And so there's a lot of efficiencies that can be achieved in the factory that you might not necessarily have on a traditional construction site. So, you know, when you're building a modular building, you can have your tables set up to build the building, right? So, you know, you can have your framing crew or your drywall crew working at the same time in the same building. You're not dealing with weather. You know, we have a lot of weather delays here in the Pacific Northwest with rain and wind and everything else. And so that can slow down a project, but it's not something that you're going to be dealing with in the factory. So I think there's a lot of efficiencies that can be gained just from the building process itself. But there's also efficiencies in the sense of, you know, from a structural perspective, you know, when you're building a traditional building, you might have 20 or 30 different wall types and 20 or 30 different floor types, right? And so every time you change from one type to another, you have to have a whole new design. And so there's a lot of engineering and a lot of drafting that goes into that. Whereas with a modular building, you're going to have the same types of walls and floors and roofs, you know, a repetitive nature. And so you can kind of streamline your design process a little bit. And you're also working with the same crew in the factory for the most part. So, you know, you have the same people that are building the first module, they're going to be building the last module. And so they kind of get a feel for the building and how it goes together. And so you're able to gain efficiencies that way as well.

Yeah, that's a really great point. And I think, you know, the fact that modular construction is done in a factory setting, it allows for more precision and quality control, which is also a benefit for structural engineering because, you know, you can ensure that the connections are done correctly, that the materials are all up to code, that the welding or any other structural components are done with precision. And so it really helps from a structural standpoint to have that controlled environment in a factory.

Yeah, and another thing too is that, you know, when you're building in the factory, you can have, you know, full-scale mock-ups and you can really kind of figure out how this thing is going to be put together before you're actually building it. So you can look at the full-size mock-up, kind of figure out how the process is going to go. And, you know, with traditional construction, you're really kind of building it as you're going and you don't necessarily have that ability to do that. So there's a lot more planning that goes into the factory construction, and I think that's another reason why it's more efficient.

Yeah, absolutely. And speaking of efficiency, does modular construction have any potential environmental benefits or sustainable advantages compared to traditional construction methods?

Yeah, I think there are some potential environmental benefits to modular construction. One of them is that because it's done in a factory setting, there can be more control over material waste. You can optimize the use of materials more efficiently, and you can also potentially recycle materials within the factory setting. Additionally, because it's done in a controlled environment, there's less exposure to the elements, which can result in less material damage and less waste. And finally, because modular construction often involves the use of prefabricated components, there can be opportunities to use more sustainable materials or incorporate energy-efficient design features into those components.

And I'll add to that as well. You know, when you're building in a factory, you're really focused on the assembly process and the manufacturing process. And so, you know, a lot of times, you're using the exact quantities that you need. You're not overordering materials and then having excess material that's not being used, which can happen in traditional construction. And, you know, there's also the opportunity to recycle and reuse materials within the factory. So, you know, if you have some, you know, leftover material from one module, you can potentially use that in another module. And so there's less waste generated overall.

Great points. It's good to see that there are some potential environmental benefits to modular construction. Now, looking ahead, how do you see the future of modular construction and structural engineering evolving? Are there any emerging trends or technologies that you're particularly excited about?

I can take that one. I think one of the emerging trends that's really exciting in modular construction is the use of automation and robotics. We're starting to see more and more automation being integrated into the manufacturing process in modular construction factories. And this can lead to increased efficiency and precision in the construction process. For example, we're seeing robotic systems being used for tasks like welding and material handling, which can help improve the quality and speed of construction. So I think that's a really exciting trend to watch. Additionally, with the advancements in digital technology, we're seeing more sophisticated design and modeling tools being used in modular construction, which can help streamline the engineering and construction process even further.

Yeah, I agree with that, Sean. And, you know, I think we're also seeing a trend towards more sustainability in modular construction. You know, as we mentioned earlier, there are some inherent benefits to sustainability in terms of waste reduction and efficient material use. But I think there's also a growing interest in using modular construction as a means to create more energy-efficient buildings and incorporate renewable energy sources. So I think that's something that we'll see more of in the future.

Absolutely. It's exciting to see how technology and sustainability are playing a role in the future of modular construction.
