Welcome, everyone! My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Gary Badge and Manny Lamarche of Florida-based design firm Fugleberg Koch. Gary and Manny are here to talk about FK's transition to new leadership and how modular design and fabrication are going to play a big role in the company's future. Gary and Manny, welcome!

Gary: Hi John, how are you doing this afternoon? We appreciate your time.

Manny: Sure, I'm doing great. I hope you guys are as well.

John: We are. I'm thrilled that you could join us today. To kick things off, Gary, could you tell me a bit about yourself and how you got into architecture?

Gary: Certainly, John. I got into architecture because it was a passion I had since my high school days. I loved building and tinkering with things, and while I was involved in athletics during my younger years, I realized that I needed something more concrete to rely on than my pitching arm. So, I decided to explore architecture, graduated from the University of Florida in 2001, and it's been an exciting journey ever since. I've worked for a few firms in South Florida and Central Florida, and I've been with Fugleberg Koch for 17 years now. It's been a homegrown journey for me, and I'm currently a principal at the firm, which is even more exciting.

John: That's excellent to hear. Manny, how about you? What's your background in architecture?

Manny: Well, I started in architecture at a relatively young age. I was 19 years old, living in South Florida, and I worked as a land surveyor and an assistant land surveyor for several years. Through that work, I started becoming more interested in how to put buildings together. After a while, I decided to go to school and earn my diploma in architecture. It's been quite a journey from there.

John: That's fascinating. Thanks for sharing. Now, tell me a bit about Fugleberg Koch. What does the firm specialize in, and what kind of services do you offer?

Gary: Fugleberg Koch, often referred to as FK, has a rich history. We've been in business for 55 or 56 years now. The firm was founded by Bob Koch and Lyle Fugleberg, and they started as a small operation in the 1960s. Over the years, the firm has grown, evolved, and survived through various economic challenges. We've always had a passion for innovation and creativity in our projects. We've worked on various sectors, including hospitality, multi-family, food and beverage, mixed-use, renovations, and more. As for the future, we believe modular construction will play a significant role in our continued success.

John: That's impressive. It sounds like FK has a wide range of experience across different sectors. Speaking of which, you mentioned your firm's interest in modular construction. What got FK interested in modular construction?

Gary: FK has always been interested in finding methods that lead to efficiencies and improvements in the design and construction process. We've always sought creative ways to expand our capabilities and provide better outcomes for our clients. With the changing landscape in construction, we recognized that modular construction could offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. So, we decided to explore modular construction as a way to integrate it into our projects and offer innovative solutions to our clients.

John: That's a great perspective. It's clear that FK sees the potential in modular construction. Now, what has been your process for learning about modular design and construction? Have there been any new techniques or processes you've had to adopt?

Manny: Learning about modular design and construction has been a multifaceted process for us. One of the significant shifts was thinking about designing for transport. In traditional construction, you don't need to consider how a building will be transported to the site. With modular, you must think about the forces of transporting a building on a flatbed truck, for instance. This has led to changes in how we approach our design grid and the parameters of designing for transport.

Another important aspect is understanding where and how connections happen in modular construction. In traditional construction, you have on-site assembly, but with modular, you need to plan for efficient assembly on-site. These considerations have informed our approach to modular design and allowed us to adapt and refine our methods.

Gary: I'd like to add that modular construction presents unique challenges and opportunities. For example, we've had to understand and communicate the benefits of modular construction to our clients. This includes educating them about the value of modular design, cost savings in the long run, and the superior quality control achieved in a factory environment.

Additionally, we've had to address concerns about who is responsible for what in modular construction. Clients often want to know when they take control of the project on-site and how much is done in the factory. This has required us to refine our communication and provide clear answers to alleviate any ambiguity.

John: It's clear that you've had to adapt and refine your processes to embrace modular design. Now, you've mentioned the challenges architects and design professionals face when embracing modular construction. Why do you think many architects and professionals in the field have been hesitant to embrace modular design fully?

Manny: I believe that reluctance to embrace modular design often stems from a fear of change. People tend to be hesitant about what they don't fully understand or what's unfamiliar to them. Traditional construction methods, like conventional framing, have been around for a long time and are well-understood. Modular construction, on the other hand, can seem like an unknown territory to many. It's important to address these misconceptions and educate professionals about the benefits and potential of modular construction.

Gary: I agree with Manny. Change is often perceived as a challenge or even a threat. People tend to stick with what they know because it's comfortable and predictable. Modular construction, being a relatively newer approach, might be intimidating to some who have been using traditional methods for years. However, with the right education and information sharing, we can help professionals see the advantages and overcome their hesitations.

John: That's a valid point. Education and information sharing are key to addressing these hesitations. Now, what can organizations like the Modular Building Institute do to help reduce these barriers for design professionals and architects in embracing modular design?

Gary: Organizations like the Modular Building Institute play a crucial role in reducing these barriers. They can continue to promote modular construction through various means, such as podcasts like this one, webinars, seminars, and networking opportunities. By providing valuable information and fostering a community where professionals can learn from one another's experiences, organizations can help architects and design professionals become more comfortable with modular construction.

Manny: I'd like to emphasize the importance of education. The more we educate ourselves about modular construction, the better equipped we'll be to educate our clients. Organizations can facilitate this by offering resources, case studies, and best practices. Additionally, events like the Modular Expo provide a platform for professionals to share their knowledge and experiences, which can be incredibly beneficial.

John: Thank you for those insights. I appreciate your perspectives on this matter. Now, can you share any details about upcoming modular projects that FK has in the pipeline? Anything particularly interesting you're working on?

Gary: We have a couple of exciting modular projects on the horizon. We're currently working with a new client that is interested in exploring modular construction. We've had initial meetings, and we're in the process of educating them about the benefits and advantages of modular construction. We believe this project could be a catalyst for further adoption of modular construction within our client's portfolio, especially in the garden-style project sector.

Additionally, we have a project out west that is considering modular construction, but with a different focus on the delivery of the project. This project involves a mixed-use environment, and we're excited to see how modular construction can fit into the broader scope of the development.

We're also working with a new client who is interested in exploring innovative approaches, including modular construction. Being at the ground floor of this collaboration is fantastic because it allows us to grow together and differentiate ourselves from the competition.

John: It sounds like you have some exciting projects ahead. We'd love to hear more about them and perhaps share some case studies in the future. Thank you both, Gary and Manny, for joining me today and sharing your insights on modular construction and FK's journey into this field.

Gary: Thank you, John. It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Manny: Yes, thank you for having us. It was great talking with you.

John: My pleasure. This has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!
