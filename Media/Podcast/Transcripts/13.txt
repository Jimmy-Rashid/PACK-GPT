Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Kevin Reed, President and CEO of Nomodic. Kevin is here to talk about the push for affordable housing across Canada and about what's going on now that can benefit modular companies coast to coast. Kevin, welcome to the podcast.

Kevin: Thanks, John. Pleasure to be here.

John: So, tell me about yourself, Kevin. How did you get into modular construction?

Kevin: I would say indirectly and by accident. I just traced it back to when I was a kid. I wanted to be one of two things, and I had an indication pretty early on that it was either chiropractic or architecture. I am neither, but I work very closely with architectural professionals and see what they do on a daily basis. Part of my job is being able to work with architects and designers. Design has been a passion of mine for years.

When I was a kid, I was in junior high and high school, and I took design studies, which exposed me to CAD and other design software, early editions of software at that time. I ended up landing a job at a university part-time while I was going to school, doing AutoCAD work on product design. I toured a modular plant for the first time in 2010, and I quickly saw the potential. From that day forward, I started to put a business plan together, and two years after that, Nomodic was born.

John: Very cool. It's always interesting to hear how people end up in the modular construction industry. Now, I've been looking at your website, and there are several mentions of Nomodic's hybrid process for modular construction. What exactly does that mean?

Kevin: The hybrid process means that we can use a hybrid of different prefabricated methodologies and materials. We can take a building and deconstruct it into the most efficient components at each stage and portion of that building. It involves using different materials and components, such as wood frame modular with steel reinforcement, adding CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) or heavy timbers, or using panelized solutions. We don't manufacture components ourselves, which gives us the flexibility to use various materials and combine them on a single project. This approach allows us to optimize the construction process for efficiency and sustainability.

John: That sounds like a flexible and efficient approach to modular construction. As the Chair of MBI's Canadian Council, you've worked a lot with MBI this year to help spearhead the industry's response to COVID-19, particularly in Western Canada. Besides that work, Nomodic has made a big business acquisition and been named one of Canada's top-growing companies. Tell me about the past several months.

Kevin: There's a lot to unpack there. It has been an interesting few months. We completed an acquisition of an industry peer, which started as a conversation between competitors. We had a healthy level of competition and respect for each other, and it quickly became a possibility. The pandemic may have expedited the process because it allowed us to make decisions more quickly without the typical travel involved in such negotiations.

The acquisition was a significant move for Nomodic, and it allowed us to build our capabilities and expand our team. We also recently earned recognition as one of Canada's top-growing companies, which reflects our focus on permanent modular construction and our ability to adapt and grow rapidly.

John: That's impressive growth and adaptability. What kind of projects have you been involved with this year?

Kevin: We've been involved in a variety of projects this year. We completed a boutique hotel in Cache Creek, British Columbia, called Duffin Cove, which is cantilevered over a cliff on the coast, offering stunning views. We also worked on a Shell gas station and convenience store, several supportive housing projects across British Columbia, and a shelter for women and children fleeing violence in Vancouver. Additionally, we're designing a fisheries laboratory on Vancouver Island and employee housing for an international luxury hotel brand within a national park in Canada.

John: That's a diverse range of projects, from hospitality to housing and more. Now, one of the reasons I was excited to talk with you today was the recent news from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). They've committed a billion dollars to their Rapid Housing Initiative, which promises to get modular affordable housing installed all over Canada. What was your reaction to that news?

Kevin: I was excited and, to some extent, surprised by the news. A lot of my peers in the modular industry, along with MBI, have been working diligently for a couple of years to educate CMHC and their counterparts in the US about the benefits and nuances of our modular construction methods. This early work has paid off, and I'm appreciative of the effort that went into building that relationship. I believe it's a positive step forward, and I'm excited to see how it will impact the industry.

John: It's certainly an exciting development for the modular construction industry and affordable housing efforts in Canada. With this initiative, what's it been like to navigate the process? Have you noticed any hiccups along the way?

Kevin: The timelines for this initiative are tight, and we've dedicated internal resources to help our clients navigate the application process. Since the program is relatively new, there are some challenges as CMHC works to refine it. The key is to focus on delivering projects within the 12-month timeframe, and this requires engaging all stakeholders early in the process. The sooner everyone is at the table, the better, as we have limited time to execute these projects successfully.

John: What should other modular construction companies do right now if they haven't started on their application? Are there any prerequisites they need to work through, or is there anything stopping them from getting started? What's the first step?

Kevin: The applications are open to various groups, including municipal, provincial, territorial governments, indigenous governing bodies and organizations, and non-profit organizations. The first step for other modular construction companies is to identify and reach out to potential partners among these groups who are interested in and have a need for modular construction. Educate them about the process and the triggers that need to be considered early. Engage all stakeholders as soon as possible, as it's crucial to streamline the process and meet the tight timelines.

John: That's a clear path for companies to follow. Now, let's revisit affordable housing for a moment. It's a significant issue not just in Canada but across North America. What's the best way for the industry to make noise, get in front of decision-makers, and advocate for affordable housing solutions?

Kevin: The most impactful thing the industry can do is to deliver. We need to excel on the projects we have the opportunity to work on. Demonstrating our capabilities and the value we bring to the table is crucial. If we execute these projects successfully, it speaks louder than anything we can say. Moreover, once we complete these projects, we need our clients and stakeholders to help spread the message. Client testimonials and success stories are powerful advocacy tools.

John: That's an excellent point. The industry's track record and the outcomes of these projects will speak volumes. Now, let's talk about Nomodic's recent partnerships with companies like FogBuilt and Nexi Building Solutions. What's the goal of these partnerships?

Kevin: I'm excited about these partnerships because they bring innovation and efficiency to the industry. Both FogBuilt and Nexi Building Solutions offer solutions that align with our commitment to sustainability and efficiency in construction.

FogBuilt focuses on modular interior solutions, and their approach to interiors aligns with our goal of creating sustainable and efficient modular buildings. On the other hand, Nexi Building Solutions is introducing innovative building materials and systems that enable us to optimize construction processes further. These partnerships allow us to leverage their expertise to deliver better, more sustainable, and cost-effective projects.

John: It's great to see how these partnerships can enhance the industry's capabilities. Now, you mentioned the importance of removing waste from the construction process. What are the advantages of doing that, and where does waste typically come from in construction?

Kevin: Waste in construction can manifest in various ways, including time delays, cost overruns, and excess leftover scrap materials. Removing waste from the construction process offers several advantages. Firstly, it leads to better project outcomes, such as completing projects faster and within budget. Time is critical, especially in affordable housing projects, where getting people off the streets quickly is essential.

Secondly, it benefits multiple stakeholders, from contractors to architects, engineers, and designers. When projects are efficient, everyone involved benefits, creating a positive impact throughout the construction cycle. Ultimately, the owner or end-user benefits the most, which is our primary goal in delivering affordable housing.

John: So, it's a win-win situation for all involved, and the owner benefits the most. Finally, what does 2021 look like for you, and what do you expect for the modular construction industry in Canada?

Kevin: I see 2021 as a positive step forward from this year. There's a lot of momentum in the industry, driven by initiatives like the Rapid Housing Initiative and a growing focus on social needs and sustainability. The pandemic has forced us to rethink and innovate in construction, and I believe this will lead to positive changes. Overall, I'm optimistic about the year ahead.

John: That's great to hear. Thank you so much, Kevin. It's been a pleasure speaking with you today.

Kevin: Thank you, John. I appreciate you inviting me.
