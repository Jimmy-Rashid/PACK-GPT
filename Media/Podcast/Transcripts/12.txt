Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Rhys Kane and Brock Elliott from Horizon North. Rhys and Brock are here to talk about the rapid rise and the need for affordable housing across Canada and how Horizon North is meeting that demand. Rhys and Brock, thanks for calling in today.

Rhys: Thanks for having me.

Brock: Thank you for having me.

John: So, tell me about yourselves. Rhys, why don't you start?

Rhys: Hey, so I'm Rhys Kane. I'm the Sales Director here at Horizon North. I'm based in Calgary in western Canada, and I focus on projects like multi-unit, multi-story housing projects, hotels, senior, student, workforce housing type projects here in western Canada and central and western US.

John: Very good. And Brock?

Brock: Thanks, John. Thanks for having us here today. My name is Brock Elliott. I'm the Director of Projects for Horizon North. In my role here, I oversee both our project management and construction departments. I'm actually based in Kamloops, British Columbia, where we have our most large-scale manufacturing facility right on our doorstep here. So, Brock, I'll stay with you. How did you get into modular construction?

Brock: Yeah, I've been almost exclusively in the modular industry in my career from university. I went to work with a company at the time called Northern Trailer here in Kamloops, British Columbia, who predominantly provided modules for oil sands and mining and more industrial focus at that point in time. Northern Trailer was subsequently purchased by Horizon North, so I went to work with Northern Trailer from my point of graduation at university, and I've been here ever since. It just transformed into Horizon North and continued to grow, and we continued to change the product lines that were going through our manufacturing facility. So, I was almost born into it after university.

John: Nice. And Rhys, how about you?

Rhys: Yeah, so I've been in modular for about seven years now. Originally, I joined a company that was an interesting role. The company was a new startup looking to utilize steel shipping containers for modular construction projects. So, it was a really interesting process, using steel modular and the repurposing of shipping containers, which I found fascinating. So, that was my entry into the industry, and got involved with MBI and have subsequently had experience with some smaller-scale wood frame manufacturing companies and now with the big guys here at Horizon North for the last year or so. So, it's been a fascinating time. I think the industry is super exciting and a great place to be right now and poised for some interesting years ahead.

John: Oh, it definitely is. It definitely is. How about Horizon North itself? You guys have been growing, particularly with the recent acquisition of NRB and some other companies. How did the company find itself in the position it's in today?

Rhys: It's an interesting story, actually. I think Brock sort of touched on it before, where here in Alberta, there's a big oil and gas industry, and the manufacturing facilities were originally set up to provide workforce camp-style infrastructure for that industry, mining, and forestry. So, we have a really good backbone of manufacturing and building modules. A few years ago, the leadership, Rod Graham and Joe Kiss, really recognized the opportunity within modular as that increasing interest in using modular for multi-story housing and hospitality projects. So, Rod Graham really spearheaded that growth, and the Modular Solutions division was born, say, five, six years ago here at Horizon North and has grown significantly since. In the last couple of years, you mentioned the NRB acquisition out east, which gives us a pan-Canadian presence with two factories in the west and one in the east, with the Calgary plant and two. And then, in the last year or so, there's also been a merger with Dexterra. So, it's an interesting time, and Horizon North is extremely committed to the modular industry, with NRB. NRB is the modular side of the business, and not just growing the company, but also growing the industry.

John: I've seen that both Horizon North and NRB have been quite active in the affordable housing market. That all began, I think, in Vancouver. Can you talk a little bit about Vancouver's modular program and how that served as a jumping-off point for the company?

Brock: Yeah, sure. I'll take that one on, John. So, essentially, I'll talk a little bit about Horizon North's involvement as the design-builder. So, Horizon North was awarded the design-build contract for a project called 220 Terminal through a competitive tender process in late 2016. This project was the first temporary modular housing project of its kind in BC. The intent was to be a pilot project, and any subsequent work that would be similar to this pilot project would be fully dependent on the successful execution of this project. So, it was a three-story modular housing facility comprised of about 40 modules right downtown Vancouver. We had roughly a six-month contract-to-completion timeline and a little less than three months from the point of starting our foundation to the point of having the building ready for occupancy on-site. The site was quite challenging; it had some contamination issues. So, we had to come up with some really creative ways to put the building on the site and still comply with the building code. We came up with ideas like a relocatable foundation system and other vehicle-relocatable components to overcome that. So, through all of these challenges, the project was successfully turned over in February 2017. At the time, the initiative was essentially to solve homelessness, and that initiative was one from the mayor at the time, Gregor Robertson. The pilot project was a success, and it was a proven concept at that point in time. Gregor Robertson carried on that as an item on his political agenda from there going forward.

John: That's really cool. That program, I think, then became the basis for a modular platform across British Columbia through BC Housing. Can you talk a little bit about that program and some of the work you did for it?

Brock: Yeah, you bet. So, since the successful completion of the pilot project, the province got a fair amount of traction on their modular housing program altogether. So, since that completion in early 2017, Horizon North has successfully completed over 40 similar projects throughout British Columbia. I really mean throughout British Columbia. We've completed projects on Vancouver Island, downtown Vancouver, Kamloops, Kelowna, Grand Forks, Dawson Creek, really east, south, west, north, you name it. We've completed these modular projects throughout BC. They range from one-story, two-story, three-story, four-story, up to a five-story building. So, 40 of them to date, and over the course of these 40 buildings, the design of the building has been progressively elaborated considering feedback from the operators, clients, and municipalities. So, the buildings have become more efficient in terms of better for our manufacturing, better for the end user and the operator, and also, just over the years, much more energy-efficient with the implementation of Step Code requirements here in British Columbia.

John: It sounds like you guys have been busy. I know modular affordable housing has become a hot topic all over Canada. I know the CMHC recently released their Rapid Housing Initiative, and you guys work all over. So, tell me what Horizon North is doing in Toronto now.

Brock: Yeah, so, as Reese mentioned, NRB, our subsidiary in Ontario, was awarded two design-build modular projects. Essentially, they're piggybacking off of almost exactly what was done in the City of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia, which made Horizon North and NRB the perfect supplier and design-builder for these projects, given that we've been there and we've done it. So, you know, we essentially took what had been done in Vancouver, conformed it to Ontario Building Code and the requests of the City of Toronto, the operator, and the end users. So, we are actively working on two projects there. One is actually being craned this week. It's a three-story supportive housing facility or affordable housing facility at 11 Macy in Toronto. The other one's still in our manufacturing facility in Grimsby, Ontario. So, they are also pilot projects. We're certainly hopeful that we see more of them, but heavily dependent on the successful execution of these two jobs. So far, they've been extremely successful, and we've had great partners in the City of Toronto and CreateTO and the City Real Estate Management Division. It's been really enjoyable.

John: That's fantastic. What can you tell me about the modular buildings themselves? What is it about their design and construction that makes them ideal for affordable housing?

Brock: It's specifically the modular components that make them ideal. There's a rapid component to the construction and the requirement, and the government's expectation or the city's expectation in this case is that they are built rapidly. So, with modular construction, we can fabricate off-site while we're completing on-site work, such as the civil and foundation, saving months on the schedule. So, what is really beneficial about the design and construction is that they're modular. You can complete these condensed time frames that are required to satisfy our end user and hopefully get some traction and more rapidly resolve the affordable housing crisis.

John: And what's the... yeah, I'm sorry, Rhys, I cut you off there.

Rhys: I was just going to jump in there, John. I mean, you know, in terms of what we've created, it's very much a repetitive, scalable approach, which works very well for this type of project. So, you know, there's a proven baseline design, standardized modules, and it's sort of a suite library. So, no matter where we're building, we have those templates. We can quickly design something, and it's the same every time for the factory. In terms of what the factory requires for those economies of scale and the fast-track production, we've done a lot of work to really get the design nailed down. So, we're creating really good, high-quality projects. These feel like homes. We're putting a lot of work into the way that they feel and the way that they look. So, it's a great program, and affordable, supportive housing in general is a really good fit for modular because of the scalable approach and the repetition throughout the building.

John: Definitely. Definitely. And speaking of other cities in North America, Rhys, in my last interview, I talked with RC Alley. He's at AO Architects about a project you guys are working on for the City of Los Angeles. Can you tell me about that project and how does it relate to what you're doing in Canada?

Rhys: Yeah, yeah, great question. So, yeah, I mean, in terms of our experience in BC, it's very, you know, very well-recognized, and it's a very good model for the province and has been very successful. When we're looking at those conditions in the different cities, Denver, Salt Lake, you know, Seattle, into California and LA, they have the same issues with construction schedules, municipal approval timelines, cost of construction, access to trades, and effectively getting these projects built in a timely and cost-effective fashion. So, as we look south of the border and into these different areas, we want to bring our experience, but we don't want to just say, "Hey, this is what we've done. Do you want to take it?" We want to really look at those conditions and work with local architects, local developers, and not-for-profits and understand what their requirements are specifically and then try and bring our experience to the table, the lessons learned we've had over the couple of thousand units we've built over the last year or so, to try and develop projects and programs within the different cities. So, I think LA is a great example. Working with RC and the AO team, we've identified a site, and we're looking at ways that we can fast-track it because if there's a city in the US that has a serious homeless housing issue, it is down there. So, we'd love... You know, we're really starting to do some more work. I mean, you know, Brock mentioned what we've done in Toronto. Toronto is one of the largest, fastest-growing cities, so they're starting to take it and do it. So, it's a really good showcase. So, I'd encourage anyone listening to the podcast to take a look at what's happening. There's lots of media around it, and you know, talk to us about how we can help bring that program into the specific city that you are looking at.

John: And how about other cities in North America? What can be done to remove barriers and implement similar programs for affordable housing?

Brock: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I think Brock sort of talked about it earlier, in the sense that, you know, Horizon North, NRB, Modular, we're the builder. You know, the modular industry, we're part of the modular industry, and what we need to do is step up when the city puts out that initiative. So, in Vancouver, you know, the mayor was very active and wanted to find ways to solve the homeless crisis. You know, BC Housing, which is the provincial authority that provides, you know, that the housing and distributes the funding and creates the program, and what Horizon North is, gives a credible and viable option to help deliver that program. So, as cities, and, you know, across North America, really start to look at it, you know, and the MBI is doing some wonderful things to help promote the industry, and there's lots of other companies doing it, there needs to be, you know, the modular industry needs to be recognized as a viable solution. We need to be credible, we need to have, you know, facilities available that can, you know, so that there's competition in the market, and we can all sort of standardize and build similar products, right? It's not the wild west where everyone's sort of doing it differently. There's lots of standardization and repeatability within the industry. So, yeah, I think that's how I see it.

Brock: Yeah, and I can add to that as well, John. I think as we expand, and if you're thinking about expanding into these different cities, local partnerships are extremely key. You know, we can't do it on our own. We need those local architects, those local developers, those local, you know, not-for-profits to help push the initiative because they understand the local conditions, the local politics, and those local needs. So, it's really about forming those local partnerships as well as you move into different cities.

John: Absolutely. Well, thank you both. I really appreciate your time today. This was a relatively speedy interview, but it sounds like you guys have a lot of resources and knowledge available. I know the issue of affordable housing isn't going anywhere, but it sounds like there are big things happening in Canada. So, I really appreciate you coming on the podcast today.

Brock: Thanks, John. Our pleasure.

Rhys: Thank you for having us.

John: My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.
