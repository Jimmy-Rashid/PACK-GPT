That's offsiteconstructionexpo.com. Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Nick Gomez, Studio Director at Lowney Architecture. Nick is here to talk about designing for modular projects. Nick, thanks for coming on today.

Nick Gomez: Hi, John. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1: It is my pleasure. Tell me about Lowney Architecture and how you got started in modular design.

Nick Gomez: Sure. I joined Lowney Architecture six years ago. When I joined, at the time, Lowney Architecture was predominantly doing about 70% retail work and about 30% housing. Through a connection with a friend of Ken Lowney, the principal who started Vida Communities, we started doing our first modular projects.

Speaker 1: Is there anything in particular that drew you to modular?

Nick Gomez: Yeah. I had been doing affordable housing for 15 years prior to joining Lowney Architecture, and some of that work included K-12 work. I was really aware of working with third-party regulatory review agencies on the K-12 projects. I was also doing housing. So, it was kind of a perfect match for doing modular projects here in California that require a third-party regulatory review through the State of California. Doing affordable housing, I was always looking at how to make efficient buildings. You need to bring buildings in on budget. So, understanding the regulatory review process was a perfect match for modular construction, and it's something I was really interested in.

Speaker 1: That's awesome. I know affordable housing is a big issue everywhere, particularly in California, but even here in Virginia, we're dealing with that a lot. Kudos to you. That's great. What is the architect's role on a modular project?

Nick Gomez: The architect's role can vary depending on the project structure. Initially, when I first started, Gerdan and ZETA would typically hire the architect who was doing the state sets. Sometimes our role was to work with the factory. However, we've moved away from that role model now. The factories prefer to work with the owner. In our current role, we're more the ring leader of the project. We still have to produce state sets for the factory and communicate everything back through the team to the contractor who will install the project at the end. There's a lot of coordination we have to do, particularly between the factory work and the site work.

Speaker 1: Are there any other members of the team with whom you work more closely than others, like the engineers, on-site installers, or the factory staff? Is there a particular relationship that's more suited for architecture?

Nick Gomez: We work with the entire team, but because these projects are very engineering-based, we do work a lot with structural engineers. They tend to be the ones who are addressing structural issues that may come up during the factory construction. So, the structural engineer is the person I have to talk to regularly on these projects. We work with the entire team, but structural engineers tend to be the ones we work most closely with.

Speaker 1: Is designing for modular very different than designing for a traditional stick-built structure, and if so, how?

Nick Gomez: Yes, they are very different. You're not only stacking things in the vertical direction with your shear and your mate walls, but you're also aligning things in the horizontal direction. On top of that, you have design parameters to maintain for shipping, such as heights and lengths. You need to consider these constraints in the 3D design of the building to make it lay out properly. Modular design is structurally different. You're repeating things as much as possible to maximize factory production. While it's different, it allows for efficient construction.

Speaker 1: When you're learning how to be an architect, this is not something that's taught. Was there a learning curve in designing for modular buildings? Did you have to rethink how you had done things in the past and come up with something new?

Nick Gomez: There was a learning curve, especially when we started collaborating with factories. Early on, we would get projects, and it was like, "They can't build this project. Let's see if we can modularize it." We learned how to divide the project into modules that made the building. Doing that multiple times helped us learn. I was interested in making efficient buildings from my early experience in affordable housing, so adapting to modular construction wasn't too challenging.

Speaker 1: What do traditional architects need to know before trying their hand at modular?

Nick Gomez: In California, with the dual regulatory review process, architects need to understand that they'll have two sets of documents: one for the state and one for the local jurisdiction. Clear scope separation between the two is crucial. There's a lot of coordination between the factory and site work, and architects need to be aware of where the factory work stops and the site work begins. Collaboration is essential.

Speaker 1: Has the pandemic affected your work in the past few months?

Nick Gomez: Personally, no. I'm busier now than I was prior to the pandemic. Most of our projects are affordable housing and were deemed essential, so they didn't stop. We even had some projects start during the pandemic. The factories we work with are in production because they were working on affordable housing projects. We're still busy, and there's a continued need for housing.

Speaker 1: That's great to hear. I've been hearing similar things from others. Is there an interesting or exciting project you're working on now?

Nick Gomez: We're getting ready to start stacking the Mayfair project in El Cerrito. It's a prominent location near a BART station, and it features a large art component. The project has an angled fa√ßade, and it's quite unique. It's challenging, but it's going to look beautiful once it's done.

Speaker 1: That sounds exciting. I'd love to see pictures of it. Thank you, Nick, for your time today. I appreciate it.

Nick Gomez: Stay safe, John. Thanks for having me on the MBI podcast.

Speaker 1: My pleasure. This has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.
