Welcome, everyone, to a new year and a new season of "Inside Modular." My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. As we all look ahead to the rest of 2021, one of the biggest things on our calendars is MBI's annual World of Modular Conference. This year's conference is scheduled for March 8th through the 12th. Because we're all still dealing with the effects of 2020, World of Modular will feel a little different this year, but we're no less excited. In fact, my guest today is Tom Hardiman, Executive Director here at the Modular Building Institute, and he's here today to talk about all the great things we've got lined up. Tom, welcome back to the podcast.

**Tom:** Hey, thanks for having me, John.

**John:** So, before we get into this year's show, for those who are new to the industry, can you describe what World of Modular is and how it came to be?

**Tom:** Sure. Well, World of Modular is really MBI's annual conference and trade show. In fact, this year is our 38th annual trade show, so it's the largest and longest-running show for commercial modular construction anywhere.

**John:** That's quite a history. Now, for those who've been attending the show for years and years, and I know there are many, let's talk about World of Modular 2021. It's going to be a different experience this year, but in many ways, it's going to be bigger and better than ever. What can you tell everyone about what's in store? And maybe you can also touch on exactly how attendees will interact in the conference itself.

**Tom:** Well, under normal circumstances, we would have been in San Diego and held this conference in person. But as you mentioned, these aren't normal circumstances. Nonetheless, we're excited about this conference because it gives us an opportunity to do things that we wouldn't be able to do in person. Just an example is the format we're using will allow you to connect with any and all attendees with just a couple of clicks of a button. That's just not something you're able to do at an in-person event. You can connect with every attendee at this conference. 

**John:** That's incredible. It sounds like the digital format has its advantages. So, let's dive into the details. How will the conference week be structured?

**Tom:** Well, we kick it off on Monday, and all times posted on the conference are Pacific times. We're doing this conference as if we were there in person. So, it'll be Monday at 11 Pacific. We'll start with our opening session and our State of the Industry presentation. That'll just give people a little highlight of what MBI accomplished in 2020 and what some of our goals and challenges are for 2021.

**John:** And I noticed that some of the times are a little irregular due to accommodating attendees from different time zones around the world.

**Tom:** That's correct. Some of the times may be a bit irregular, but we're trying to accommodate everyone around the world. We've got people in Australia, Europe, North America, so it's a bit unconventional, but there's a reason for that. It allows us to reach a global audience.

**John:** That's a smart approach. Now, after the State of the Industry, there's the annual business meeting, right? For those who haven't attended one of those meetings before, it seems like the digital format is ideal for that meeting. What can attendees expect there?

**Tom:** Yes, that's actually the main reason the association has a conference each year: that business meeting is to conduct our association's business. We elect our new board at that session. It gives members an opportunity to hear about the state of the association itself, the finances, the leadership, things like that. It's a bit of an inside look at how the organization is running.

**John:** Got it. So, beyond the opening events, this year's World of Modular is packed with speakers, as you mentioned before. What can you tell us about this year's lineup?

**Tom:** We're bringing back a crowd favorite, Anirban Basu, the Chief Economist for Associated Builders and Contractors. But we're kind of doubling up. We also have the Chief Economist for Associated General Contractors. So, if you're in the construction industry, you're going to hear from two of the leading economists in the country. Both will be at World of Modular presenting. We have keynote speaker Mark Farmer, who is a highly regarded consultant for the UK market. So, we'll have a really global presence with just the keynote speakers. But the breakout sessions, yeah, it's a who's who in the modular industry. We mentioned over 60 breakout sessions. Incredible lineup this year.

**John:** It sounds like an impressive lineup indeed. Now, one of the big draws for the conference is the presentation of our annual Awards of Distinction. These awards go to outstanding examples of modular construction in a variety of categories and serve as benchmarks for the industry. As the MC for these events, can we expect any big changes? And what's it like transitioning to a digital show for this part of the event?

**Tom:** We want to take the best of the in-person event and have a ceremony similar to what we do in person. The difference is that there will be some differences. First of all, the projects this year were phenomenal. The projects that our member companies submitted, so many good projects. So, we want to highlight all of those. It will be much easier for people to vote for their "Best of Show" entries because, again, they'll all be available there to click the button. 

Certainly, we'll give out our usual prizes. We'll induct a Hall of Fame inductee this year. We'll have our Outstanding Achievement. That'll all be virtual, but we want to make it very special this year again.

**John:** It's great to hear that you're making an effort to highlight the exceptional projects, even in a digital format. Now, another question for you: one of the main attractions at World of Modular is the exhibit hall. How will that work in a digital conference?

**Tom:** That's a great question. Everything in this conference will be available in this EventMobi platform. We will have digital expo booths. So, you'll be able to click on whichever booth you want to visit. There will be videos or documents you can download. But really, we want you to connect with those exhibitors. There'll be multiple ways for you to interact and connect with the exhibitors. You can schedule

 appointments with exhibitors. It gives you a chance really to get around and, once again, visit every booth available at World of Modular, which is probably something you could not have done in person. But the platform's there. It's literally everything's a few clicks away for you.

**John:** That's convenient. And attendees can do this on their computer, phone, tablet, or any device they prefer?

**Tom:** Absolutely. You can access it from your computer, phone, tablet, or whatever device you have.

**John:** Perfect. And there's also a grand prize this year. How will that work, and what can attendees look forward to there?

**Tom:** Well, we usually have a lot of fun with that, and Bard Manufacturing sponsors our grand prize every year for the last several years. And we make it fun. If you've been there in person, we play some games, and people are finalists. We tend to make them kind of embarrass themselves a little bit to win the prize. This year, in addition to great networking, great events, new connections, you have a chance to win ten thousand dollars that week while participating at World of Modular. Cash money. It's a great prize this year.

**John:** Cash, cash, cash. Very good. So, another question for you: for those still on the fence about attending this year's World of Modular, what's your message to them?

**Tom:** Get off the fence. In all seriousness, we have a very low attendee rate. We have a corporate pass, so if you're a member, you can pay a flat $2,500 and send as many people in your company as you want to. I just heard we had a company that is sending 50 people because at a flat $2,500, that's nothing. That's a no-brainer. This is a great opportunity to make new connections, to reconnect with some long-time friends, to learn a ton about what's going on in the industry. If you're new to modular, this is like a week-long university for you. There's no better opportunity to learn, to network. It's still the marquee event in the modular construction industry.

**John:** Thank you, Tom. I know you're busy. I appreciate your time today. As a final reminder, if you haven't registered for World of Modular, please go ahead and do that. WorldOfModular.org is the site. There are register buttons all over the place. It's going to be a great conference.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!
