Introduction:
Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Rob Gillingham and Bob Spista of Innovative Modular Solutions. They're here today to talk about how well-suited modular construction is for educational buildings and about some specific projects on which they've recently worked. Rob and Bob, thanks for calling in today.

Rob's Background:
Rob, could you tell us about yourself and your background?
Rob Gillingham: Sure, John. Thanks for having us. I've been with Innovative Modular Solutions for a while now. But before that, I had a different career in sales and management in the IT industry. I joined the U.S. Air Force and later moved into project management and operations management. I eventually found my passion for building and construction, which led me to the modular construction industry. It's been a great second career for me.

Bob's Background:
Great. Thanks, Rob. Bob, how about you? What's your background?
Bob Spista: Well, I started in the modular industry back in 1985 and held various sales and management positions within GE Capital Modular Space. I helped Innovative Modular Solutions begin operations in 1999 and later moved to Tennessee to open our Southeast branch in 2008. Since then, we've expanded our sales coverage to include about six states in the Southeastern U.S.

Benefits of Modular Construction in Education:
John McMullen: Thanks for sharing, both of you. Now, generally speaking, what benefits can modular construction bring to the education sector?
Bob Spista: Modular construction can provide schools with several different options for short-term and long-term space requirements. Whether a school is new, expanding, or renovating, modular construction offers a viable solution that can be delivered quickly. For instance, charter schools often lease existing church properties with auditoriums, gyms, and kitchens, allowing them to add modular classrooms as their student population grows.

Rob Gillingham: I completely agree with Bob. The speed of delivery is a key advantage, especially for public schools with limited budgets and strict timelines. Modular construction allows us to meet the needs of schools quickly and efficiently, and we can customize buildings to meet their specific requirements.

Winkelmann Elementary School Expansion Project:
John McMullen: Rob, you recently worked on the Winkelmann Elementary School expansion project. Can you tell us more about how that project got started?
Rob Gillingham: Certainly. The project began when I met the assistant superintendent at the Illinois Association of School Business Officials (IASBO) trade show. She initially contacted me to inquire about removing some old modular buildings on their property that were no longer in use. We successfully handled that, which helped build our relationship.

Later, she reached out again to discuss expanding their existing school to accommodate new programs, including a pre-K program and special needs programs. We worked on the design and layout of the additional space, reviewed it with the district, and once they approved it, we began the project.

Site Preparation:
John McMullen: What was the process for preparing the site for the expansion?
Rob Gillingham: We acted as the general contractor for this project, so we handled all the site work, including working with local municipalities and the Regional Office of Education (ROE) for permitting. We designed the site plan with the district's architect, built a permanent foundation, and set the building on it. We also ran utilities, such as gas and electrical, and completed all the necessary work on-site to ensure the building met code requirements.

Matching the Exterior:
John McMullen: I noticed in the case study that the district wanted the exterior of the expansion to match the existing school building. Can you tell us more about how you achieved that?
Rob Gillingham: Yes, the district was concerned about how the new expansion would blend in with the existing school and the surrounding neighborhood. We had several meetings with various committees, including the appearance committee and the building committee. They wanted to ensure that the new building seamlessly matched the old one.

To achieve this, we had to make sure the brick we used matched the existing school's brick, even though the school was built several years earlier. We collaborated with a local mason to find matching brick samples and presented them during the committee meetings. Ultimately, we used the selected brick to create a veneer on the building after it was transported and set on-site, resulting in a cohesive look that blends seamlessly with the original structure.

Installation Process:
John McMullen: Can you share more details about the installation process itself? Did it cause any disruption to the main school or the students?
Rob Gillingham: Modular construction offers several advantages, one of which is minimal disruption to the site and the students. For the Winkelmann Elementary School project, we acted as the full general contractor, handling all the site work. We completed the building's installation before the school year began, ensuring that it didn't disrupt the students or the school's operations.

The building itself featured high-quality finishes, including gypsum board, LVT tile, ceramic walls and floors in the corridor, floor-to-ceiling ceramic in the restrooms, granite countertops, and ADA-compliant single-use restrooms with hand sinks. The construction process was completed smoothly without impacting the school's function.

Phased Modular Project:
John McMullen: Bob, you mentioned that you worked on a phased modular project for Green Dot Public Schools' Bluff City High School. Could you tell us more about how that project unfolded and the phases involved?
Bob Spista: Certainly, John. Green Dot Public Schools wanted to open a high school in Memphis, but finding an existing facility was challenging. They initially leased church property across from the middle school they had opened a few years earlier. The church had a gym and library, which the schools shared, and we helped them add modular classrooms as their student population grew.

The project was divided into three phases. Phase one involved nine classrooms and administrative space, phase two added ten more classrooms with restrooms connected to phase one, and phase three added 18 classrooms, a teacher resource center, and additional offices. Each phase was completed in a timely manner to accommodate the school's growing needs.

Phased Installation:
John McMullen: How quickly were each of these phases completed and placed on-site?
Bob Spista: Phase one took approximately five months to complete, phase two was completed in three months, and phase three took about five months to finish. We had to make sure that the site, including utilities, parking, and sidewalks, was designed to accommodate all three phases from the beginning. This approach reduced costs and ensured a smooth installation process.

Modular vs. Freestanding Modular Additions:
John McMullen: Rob, Bob, could you share your thoughts on the differences between working on modular expansions and freestanding modular buildings?
Rob Gillingham: One of the significant advantages of modular construction is that we do a lot of pre-design work to anticipate and address potential issues ahead of time. This is different from traditional freestanding construction, which may involve more changes and potential budget impacts due to unforeseen issues during construction. With modular, we identify potential challenges upfront, and once the plan is set, we stay on course, which leads to on-time and on-budget projects.

Bob Spista: I agree with Rob. Modular projects involve a more thorough pre-design phase, which helps minimize changes and surprises during construction. This approach makes the budgeting process more predictable and keeps the project on track. Traditional construction projects can sometimes experience more changes and delays due to unforeseen issues.

Structural and Code Considerations:
John McMullen: Are there any structural or code considerations unique to designing educational buildings with modular construction, or do they closely resemble traditional construction?
Rob Gillingham: From my experience, the structural and code considerations for educational buildings in modular construction closely resemble those of traditional construction. Schools have specific lighting, ventilation, and ADA requirements, which we can easily accommodate in modular construction. Modular buildings are built to meet all relevant codes and standards, ensuring they provide a safe and compliant environment for students and staff.

Bob Spista: I'd echo what Rob mentioned. Modular construction allows us to meet all the requirements and codes for educational buildings, just like traditional construction. We can provide the same features and amenities required for schools, making it a suitable choice for educational projects.

Customization:
John McMullen: How much customization can communities apply to modular buildings to meet the unique needs of their students?
Rob Gillingham: Modular construction is highly customizable, and we've been able to accommodate a wide range of customization requests. Schools can specify their space requirements, interior finishes, and other features to suit their needs. Whether it's the layout of classrooms, specialized facilities, or unique finishes, modular construction can provide the flexibility to meet specific requirements.

Bob Spista: That's correct. Modular construction allows for a high degree of customization, and we work closely with schools to ensure their buildings meet their unique needs. This includes everything from classroom layouts to specialized facilities like science labs or music rooms. The exterior and interior finishes can also be customized to match the school's preferences and branding.

Future Projects:
John McMullen: What projects are you currently working on or planning for the future?
Rob Gillingham: We've recently completed a variety of projects, including public and private school expansions, temporary classroom installations, and building modifications to support social distancing measures. We continue to receive inquiries from schools looking for modular solutions to address their space needs quickly and efficiently.

Bob Spista: In the Southeast, we're wrapping up a large private school project in North Carolina and assisting with the design of several large modular school projects set to be completed next summer. Additionally, we're working on projects involving temporary classrooms and building modifications to meet the evolving needs of schools.

Closing Remarks:
John McMullen: Thank you both for joining us today. It's clear that modular construction has a significant role to play in the education sector, offering speed, customization, and flexibility to meet the unique requirements of schools. We appreciate your insights and the valuable work you're doing in the modular industry.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by RC Alley, partner at AO Architects in Los Angeles. RC is here to talk about designing for modular construction, and in particular, how modular buildings are a perfect solution for the nation's affordable housing dilemma. RC, thanks for being on today.

RC: Thank you, John, for inviting me. 

John: Tell me about yourself, RC. What got you interested in architecture, and how long have you been designing?

RC: I'm a second-generation architect. My father practiced in Chicago, where he worked for Mies van der Rohe. So, I was always around architecture, even though they moved to New Mexico, which is where I was born and raised. I've always been around architecture, particularly around more contemporary, mid-century modern buildings. So, it was just something that was ingrained in me from the get-go. I would say I also have that's kind of what my ingrained skills are; my skill sets are. I don't know if I could do anything other than being an architect. That's just because that's how I'm wired.

John: Gotcha. So, tell me about AO. You're based just outside of Los Angeles, is that right?

RC: Yes, we're actually in Orange County, which is about 30 miles south of Los Angeles. We have been around; the firm was founded in 1974 by my partner, Jack Selman. He's still the senior partner here. Initially, it started as a retail firm, and as it grew, we added disciplines. It went from retail, and they started doing industrial work, started doing larger retail projects. We do factory outlet center work all around the world now. We're about 270 people in size, and we are the largest firm in Orange County. Of the 270 people, about 130 of them are in my team, which is the multi-family and mixed-use team. We're very busy. My team started with me; I had been here working for the retail division. I left; I came here in 1989. I left for a couple of years, and I came back. I went to a firm where I learned multi-family, and I came back here to do one apartment project. So, the multi-family division at that time was me; I would design them, I would do the drawings on them, and I would do the fieldwork on them. As we continued to grow and evolved as a firm, but even as a group, my whole team evolved. So now, we do work all over the western US. That's what my team does because we like to limit our travel time. But I have partners that do work all around the world.

John: That's quite a bit of growth. That's impressive. So, has AO been designing modular buildings for a long time, or is that a relatively new avenue for you?

RC: It's something that we've been keenly interested in, in particular, between the multi-family team and our hospitality team for more than 10 years. It's been part of our think tank efforts. I'd say 10 years or more, we've been interested in it. But our first project that solidified was about six years ago on the hospitality side, where we built a project in Hawthorne, which is just south of LA. The other thing that's interesting with working with him is he's very passionate about it, to the point where he has built his own modular factory now, AutoBox, up in Idaho. So, we've had a lot of opportunity to be very involved in developing the systems and the design parameters that are coming out of this factory right now.

John: Cool. Well, he sounds like a great future guest. I'll have to find a way to track him down.

RC: I think he would be a good one for you. 

John: Thank you. What are the advantages you see in designing for modular construction?

RC: There are a bunch of them. A lot of them have to do with speed, speed to market, weather conditions. If you're building in an environment that has a short duration for the summer months, like maybe Idaho, for instance. But we're really seeing them on the affordable project. If there are labor challenges with labor constraints in the market, it really helps alleviate some of those challenges. So, we're very optimistic about the continued evolution and acceptance of modular projects in the market.

John: For those unfamiliar, is designing for modular much different than designing for traditional buildings?

RC: Absolutely. It's very, very different. I would say, first of all, it takes a very disciplined approach to really design it. You have to really understand the technology behind the product. You have to understand if you're doing... You have to understand what the constraints are in the factory in terms of length. You have to understand all the challenges with transporting the modules, how the buildings are assembled. It really requires a commitment to it. If you're going to do a modular project, first of all, you need to understand it, which means you need to walk some projects. You need to go to the factory and understand what those are about and understand even some of the utilitarian aspects of it. But you have to be committed to it. If you're doing a podium project, of course, that's field-built. The podium component has to be built in the field, but everything above it can be modular. So, if you're going to do it, I tell clients, if you're going to do a modular project, you have to be committed to do it fully. You can't do it partially modular and partially field-built, especially in the areas that it could actually be built in a factory.

John: I'm going to switch gears on you just a little bit. I know affordable housing is a big interest of yours. What can you tell me about the housing situation in LA?

RC: Boy, that's a good question. LA is its own animal, of course. Right now, there's about, if you read any of the information, there's a housing shortage in LA of 400,000 to 500,000 units. There's a significant challenge with homelessness and a need for housing in general. There's a big demand there, and there's also a large desire to do housing in LA, but it's just challenging. It's in California. Some things that have occurred over the last year or several years have really helped push housing projects forward, especially affordable housing, which is what a lot of our modular projects are. The Senate Bill SB 1818, which is the state density bonus law, the Senate Bill 330, which is the Housing Crisis Act of 2019, there's a Senate Bill... I'm sorry, Assembly Bill 2345, which is to

 promote affordable housing. So, all these bills have been passed, which have made it a little bit easier to do these types of projects, which is great.

John: In what ways do you see modular construction as a solution to this housing crisis in Los Angeles?

RC: In particular, when we're doing modular, we do it for the affordable projects for the most part. Some of the affordable projects that we've done, which are all located in the city of LA or in the county, they have committed to do these. The city is trying to meet their objectives of providing housing, especially affordable housing, and they're committed to doing it. So, it's very refreshing for us. There's an extensive commitment to trying to bring the cost down and to trying to get units out there as quickly as possible. So, we've had projects that we've done, which have been very challenging in terms of budget. But the city has really committed to doing whatever they can to make the project pencil out. So, it's refreshing for us. 

John: You mentioned SB 1818 and AB 2345. How do those work in tandem with modular construction projects to make it easier to get affordable housing built?

RC: They don't necessarily make it easier to get it built, but they make it easier to get it financed. For instance, under 2345, for instance, there's one provision that's great. It allows for... As we know, there's always a concern with parking and the requirement to provide parking in a project. Well, 2345 actually allows for a 100% reduction in parking requirements. So, that means you can build more units on the site. So, that's a great benefit. So, we're seeing more of the reduction of the parking spaces. And what we're trying to do on all our projects is to get a really high percentage of two-bedroom and three-bedroom units because there's a tremendous need for it. That's also something that's required by the state density bonus law.

So, 2345... And this is the thing with 2345, is there's always been a requirement that there's a 15% affordable requirement on projects, which is great. That's always been in place for a while. The problem is there was no differentiation between levels of affordability. Now there's a requirement that out of that 15% affordable requirement, there has to be a component of that which is at 30% of median income. That's very, very difficult to do because there's no money in that. So, it's a challenge. But at the end of the day, all these things are tools to help make the project more feasible. In terms of the density bonus, if you're doing a 100% affordable project, you're allowed a 50% increase in density on the site, which is huge. That's one of the provisions of that. That helps make projects more feasible because that's also something that you can then take to a bank and get it financed.

John: Let's talk a little bit about density. You mentioned the density bonus law. One of the arguments I hear against modular construction is that it's not as efficient in terms of land use because you have to transport these larger modules to the site. What's your response to that?

RC: I don't know if that's necessarily true because there's still a requirement for you to provide all the parking spaces on the site. So, if you're building an apartment project, a four-story apartment project on a small site, you're required to have a specific number of parking spaces. It's not as though you're getting a 100% reduction in the parking spaces. It's not like in New York City where there's a big push for... Or in San Francisco, where they're reducing the parking requirements significantly. It's not like that in LA. So, I don't know if it's more land-efficient, but it's certainly more efficient in terms of building the building because we're able to do that in a much shorter duration. The four-story podium that I mentioned earlier, for instance, we're doing one in San Pedro. It's 180 units. It's 800 modules. That would have taken a year and a half to two years to build in the field. But we're doing it in four months.

So, what that does is it makes the project that much more feasible, especially for a developer that has an equity partner or that has debt on the project. You're paying your interest on your debt much sooner because you're in and out of that project so much quicker. So, that makes a huge difference. The time you're saving is probably 25% to 30% of the schedule. So, on a project, you're probably saving six months on a project that would normally take two years to build. So, that's huge.

John: Do you have any advice for architects who might be considering getting into modular design?

RC: Yes, I would say that it's not for the faint of heart. It's not something that you can dabble in. You have to really be committed to doing it. It is a new technology. It's been around for a while, but it's still not something that's been embraced by the market. But I do see that happening. I've been committed to doing this for 10 years, but I see it happening. I see the push for it happening. I think with all these bills, the city and the county, they're committed to making it happen. I think that in 10 years, it's going to be a very large percentage of the multi-family market. So, if you're interested in doing that, you have to learn about it, which means you have to go out and do some site visits. You have to get to know the fabricators. You have to get to know the technology behind it, which is like anything else. But again, I'll say, if you're going to do it, you have to be committed to it.

John: Great advice. Well, that's all I have for you today, RC. Thank you for joining me and sharing your insights on modular construction and affordable housing.

RC: Thank you, John. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about modular.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Rhys Kane and Brock Elliott from Horizon North. Rhys and Brock are here to talk about the rapid rise and the need for affordable housing across Canada and how Horizon North is meeting that demand. Rhys and Brock, thanks for calling in today.

Rhys: Thanks for having me.

Brock: Thank you for having me.

John: So, tell me about yourselves. Rhys, why don't you start?

Rhys: Hey, so I'm Rhys Kane. I'm the Sales Director here at Horizon North. I'm based in Calgary in western Canada, and I focus on projects like multi-unit, multi-story housing projects, hotels, senior, student, workforce housing type projects here in western Canada and central and western US.

John: Very good. And Brock?

Brock: Thanks, John. Thanks for having us here today. My name is Brock Elliott. I'm the Director of Projects for Horizon North. In my role here, I oversee both our project management and construction departments. I'm actually based in Kamloops, British Columbia, where we have our most large-scale manufacturing facility right on our doorstep here. So, Brock, I'll stay with you. How did you get into modular construction?

Brock: Yeah, I've been almost exclusively in the modular industry in my career from university. I went to work with a company at the time called Northern Trailer here in Kamloops, British Columbia, who predominantly provided modules for oil sands and mining and more industrial focus at that point in time. Northern Trailer was subsequently purchased by Horizon North, so I went to work with Northern Trailer from my point of graduation at university, and I've been here ever since. It just transformed into Horizon North and continued to grow, and we continued to change the product lines that were going through our manufacturing facility. So, I was almost born into it after university.

John: Nice. And Rhys, how about you?

Rhys: Yeah, so I've been in modular for about seven years now. Originally, I joined a company that was an interesting role. The company was a new startup looking to utilize steel shipping containers for modular construction projects. So, it was a really interesting process, using steel modular and the repurposing of shipping containers, which I found fascinating. So, that was my entry into the industry, and got involved with MBI and have subsequently had experience with some smaller-scale wood frame manufacturing companies and now with the big guys here at Horizon North for the last year or so. So, it's been a fascinating time. I think the industry is super exciting and a great place to be right now and poised for some interesting years ahead.

John: Oh, it definitely is. It definitely is. How about Horizon North itself? You guys have been growing, particularly with the recent acquisition of NRB and some other companies. How did the company find itself in the position it's in today?

Rhys: It's an interesting story, actually. I think Brock sort of touched on it before, where here in Alberta, there's a big oil and gas industry, and the manufacturing facilities were originally set up to provide workforce camp-style infrastructure for that industry, mining, and forestry. So, we have a really good backbone of manufacturing and building modules. A few years ago, the leadership, Rod Graham and Joe Kiss, really recognized the opportunity within modular as that increasing interest in using modular for multi-story housing and hospitality projects. So, Rod Graham really spearheaded that growth, and the Modular Solutions division was born, say, five, six years ago here at Horizon North and has grown significantly since. In the last couple of years, you mentioned the NRB acquisition out east, which gives us a pan-Canadian presence with two factories in the west and one in the east, with the Calgary plant and two. And then, in the last year or so, there's also been a merger with Dexterra. So, it's an interesting time, and Horizon North is extremely committed to the modular industry, with NRB. NRB is the modular side of the business, and not just growing the company, but also growing the industry.

John: I've seen that both Horizon North and NRB have been quite active in the affordable housing market. That all began, I think, in Vancouver. Can you talk a little bit about Vancouver's modular program and how that served as a jumping-off point for the company?

Brock: Yeah, sure. I'll take that one on, John. So, essentially, I'll talk a little bit about Horizon North's involvement as the design-builder. So, Horizon North was awarded the design-build contract for a project called 220 Terminal through a competitive tender process in late 2016. This project was the first temporary modular housing project of its kind in BC. The intent was to be a pilot project, and any subsequent work that would be similar to this pilot project would be fully dependent on the successful execution of this project. So, it was a three-story modular housing facility comprised of about 40 modules right downtown Vancouver. We had roughly a six-month contract-to-completion timeline and a little less than three months from the point of starting our foundation to the point of having the building ready for occupancy on-site. The site was quite challenging; it had some contamination issues. So, we had to come up with some really creative ways to put the building on the site and still comply with the building code. We came up with ideas like a relocatable foundation system and other vehicle-relocatable components to overcome that. So, through all of these challenges, the project was successfully turned over in February 2017. At the time, the initiative was essentially to solve homelessness, and that initiative was one from the mayor at the time, Gregor Robertson. The pilot project was a success, and it was a proven concept at that point in time. Gregor Robertson carried on that as an item on his political agenda from there going forward.

John: That's really cool. That program, I think, then became the basis for a modular platform across British Columbia through BC Housing. Can you talk a little bit about that program and some of the work you did for it?

Brock: Yeah, you bet. So, since the successful completion of the pilot project, the province got a fair amount of traction on their modular housing program altogether. So, since that completion in early 2017, Horizon North has successfully completed over 40 similar projects throughout British Columbia. I really mean throughout British Columbia. We've completed projects on Vancouver Island, downtown Vancouver, Kamloops, Kelowna, Grand Forks, Dawson Creek, really east, south, west, north, you name it. We've completed these modular projects throughout BC. They range from one-story, two-story, three-story, four-story, up to a five-story building. So, 40 of them to date, and over the course of these 40 buildings, the design of the building has been progressively elaborated considering feedback from the operators, clients, and municipalities. So, the buildings have become more efficient in terms of better for our manufacturing, better for the end user and the operator, and also, just over the years, much more energy-efficient with the implementation of Step Code requirements here in British Columbia.

John: It sounds like you guys have been busy. I know modular affordable housing has become a hot topic all over Canada. I know the CMHC recently released their Rapid Housing Initiative, and you guys work all over. So, tell me what Horizon North is doing in Toronto now.

Brock: Yeah, so, as Reese mentioned, NRB, our subsidiary in Ontario, was awarded two design-build modular projects. Essentially, they're piggybacking off of almost exactly what was done in the City of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia, which made Horizon North and NRB the perfect supplier and design-builder for these projects, given that we've been there and we've done it. So, you know, we essentially took what had been done in Vancouver, conformed it to Ontario Building Code and the requests of the City of Toronto, the operator, and the end users. So, we are actively working on two projects there. One is actually being craned this week. It's a three-story supportive housing facility or affordable housing facility at 11 Macy in Toronto. The other one's still in our manufacturing facility in Grimsby, Ontario. So, they are also pilot projects. We're certainly hopeful that we see more of them, but heavily dependent on the successful execution of these two jobs. So far, they've been extremely successful, and we've had great partners in the City of Toronto and CreateTO and the City Real Estate Management Division. It's been really enjoyable.

John: That's fantastic. What can you tell me about the modular buildings themselves? What is it about their design and construction that makes them ideal for affordable housing?

Brock: It's specifically the modular components that make them ideal. There's a rapid component to the construction and the requirement, and the government's expectation or the city's expectation in this case is that they are built rapidly. So, with modular construction, we can fabricate off-site while we're completing on-site work, such as the civil and foundation, saving months on the schedule. So, what is really beneficial about the design and construction is that they're modular. You can complete these condensed time frames that are required to satisfy our end user and hopefully get some traction and more rapidly resolve the affordable housing crisis.

John: And what's the... yeah, I'm sorry, Rhys, I cut you off there.

Rhys: I was just going to jump in there, John. I mean, you know, in terms of what we've created, it's very much a repetitive, scalable approach, which works very well for this type of project. So, you know, there's a proven baseline design, standardized modules, and it's sort of a suite library. So, no matter where we're building, we have those templates. We can quickly design something, and it's the same every time for the factory. In terms of what the factory requires for those economies of scale and the fast-track production, we've done a lot of work to really get the design nailed down. So, we're creating really good, high-quality projects. These feel like homes. We're putting a lot of work into the way that they feel and the way that they look. So, it's a great program, and affordable, supportive housing in general is a really good fit for modular because of the scalable approach and the repetition throughout the building.

John: Definitely. Definitely. And speaking of other cities in North America, Rhys, in my last interview, I talked with RC Alley. He's at AO Architects about a project you guys are working on for the City of Los Angeles. Can you tell me about that project and how does it relate to what you're doing in Canada?

Rhys: Yeah, yeah, great question. So, yeah, I mean, in terms of our experience in BC, it's very, you know, very well-recognized, and it's a very good model for the province and has been very successful. When we're looking at those conditions in the different cities, Denver, Salt Lake, you know, Seattle, into California and LA, they have the same issues with construction schedules, municipal approval timelines, cost of construction, access to trades, and effectively getting these projects built in a timely and cost-effective fashion. So, as we look south of the border and into these different areas, we want to bring our experience, but we don't want to just say, "Hey, this is what we've done. Do you want to take it?" We want to really look at those conditions and work with local architects, local developers, and not-for-profits and understand what their requirements are specifically and then try and bring our experience to the table, the lessons learned we've had over the couple of thousand units we've built over the last year or so, to try and develop projects and programs within the different cities. So, I think LA is a great example. Working with RC and the AO team, we've identified a site, and we're looking at ways that we can fast-track it because if there's a city in the US that has a serious homeless housing issue, it is down there. So, we'd love... You know, we're really starting to do some more work. I mean, you know, Brock mentioned what we've done in Toronto. Toronto is one of the largest, fastest-growing cities, so they're starting to take it and do it. So, it's a really good showcase. So, I'd encourage anyone listening to the podcast to take a look at what's happening. There's lots of media around it, and you know, talk to us about how we can help bring that program into the specific city that you are looking at.

John: And how about other cities in North America? What can be done to remove barriers and implement similar programs for affordable housing?

Brock: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I think Brock sort of talked about it earlier, in the sense that, you know, Horizon North, NRB, Modular, we're the builder. You know, the modular industry, we're part of the modular industry, and what we need to do is step up when the city puts out that initiative. So, in Vancouver, you know, the mayor was very active and wanted to find ways to solve the homeless crisis. You know, BC Housing, which is the provincial authority that provides, you know, that the housing and distributes the funding and creates the program, and what Horizon North is, gives a credible and viable option to help deliver that program. So, as cities, and, you know, across North America, really start to look at it, you know, and the MBI is doing some wonderful things to help promote the industry, and there's lots of other companies doing it, there needs to be, you know, the modular industry needs to be recognized as a viable solution. We need to be credible, we need to have, you know, facilities available that can, you know, so that there's competition in the market, and we can all sort of standardize and build similar products, right? It's not the wild west where everyone's sort of doing it differently. There's lots of standardization and repeatability within the industry. So, yeah, I think that's how I see it.

Brock: Yeah, and I can add to that as well, John. I think as we expand, and if you're thinking about expanding into these different cities, local partnerships are extremely key. You know, we can't do it on our own. We need those local architects, those local developers, those local, you know, not-for-profits to help push the initiative because they understand the local conditions, the local politics, and those local needs. So, it's really about forming those local partnerships as well as you move into different cities.

John: Absolutely. Well, thank you both. I really appreciate your time today. This was a relatively speedy interview, but it sounds like you guys have a lot of resources and knowledge available. I know the issue of affordable housing isn't going anywhere, but it sounds like there are big things happening in Canada. So, I really appreciate you coming on the podcast today.

Brock: Thanks, John. Our pleasure.

Rhys: Thank you for having us.

John: My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Today's episode is also brought to you by the Off-Site Construction Expo, sponsored by the Modular Building Institute. Visit offsiteconstructionexpo.com today to join industry speakers, exhibitors, and attendees for the next virtual expo of 2020, this time aimed at the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic regions on November 18th. Now anyone can attend for only $199. Register today at offsiteconstructionexpo.com.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Kevin Reed, President and CEO of Nomodic. Kevin is here to talk about the push for affordable housing across Canada and about what's going on now that can benefit modular companies coast to coast. Kevin, welcome to the podcast.

Kevin: Thanks, John. Pleasure to be here.

John: So, tell me about yourself, Kevin. How did you get into modular construction?

Kevin: I would say indirectly and by accident. I just traced it back to when I was a kid. I wanted to be one of two things, and I had an indication pretty early on that it was either chiropractic or architecture. I am neither, but I work very closely with architectural professionals and see what they do on a daily basis. Part of my job is being able to work with architects and designers. Design has been a passion of mine for years.

When I was a kid, I was in junior high and high school, and I took design studies, which exposed me to CAD and other design software, early editions of software at that time. I ended up landing a job at a university part-time while I was going to school, doing AutoCAD work on product design. I toured a modular plant for the first time in 2010, and I quickly saw the potential. From that day forward, I started to put a business plan together, and two years after that, Nomodic was born.

John: Very cool. It's always interesting to hear how people end up in the modular construction industry. Now, I've been looking at your website, and there are several mentions of Nomodic's hybrid process for modular construction. What exactly does that mean?

Kevin: The hybrid process means that we can use a hybrid of different prefabricated methodologies and materials. We can take a building and deconstruct it into the most efficient components at each stage and portion of that building. It involves using different materials and components, such as wood frame modular with steel reinforcement, adding CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) or heavy timbers, or using panelized solutions. We don't manufacture components ourselves, which gives us the flexibility to use various materials and combine them on a single project. This approach allows us to optimize the construction process for efficiency and sustainability.

John: That sounds like a flexible and efficient approach to modular construction. As the Chair of MBI's Canadian Council, you've worked a lot with MBI this year to help spearhead the industry's response to COVID-19, particularly in Western Canada. Besides that work, Nomodic has made a big business acquisition and been named one of Canada's top-growing companies. Tell me about the past several months.

Kevin: There's a lot to unpack there. It has been an interesting few months. We completed an acquisition of an industry peer, which started as a conversation between competitors. We had a healthy level of competition and respect for each other, and it quickly became a possibility. The pandemic may have expedited the process because it allowed us to make decisions more quickly without the typical travel involved in such negotiations.

The acquisition was a significant move for Nomodic, and it allowed us to build our capabilities and expand our team. We also recently earned recognition as one of Canada's top-growing companies, which reflects our focus on permanent modular construction and our ability to adapt and grow rapidly.

John: That's impressive growth and adaptability. What kind of projects have you been involved with this year?

Kevin: We've been involved in a variety of projects this year. We completed a boutique hotel in Cache Creek, British Columbia, called Duffin Cove, which is cantilevered over a cliff on the coast, offering stunning views. We also worked on a Shell gas station and convenience store, several supportive housing projects across British Columbia, and a shelter for women and children fleeing violence in Vancouver. Additionally, we're designing a fisheries laboratory on Vancouver Island and employee housing for an international luxury hotel brand within a national park in Canada.

John: That's a diverse range of projects, from hospitality to housing and more. Now, one of the reasons I was excited to talk with you today was the recent news from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). They've committed a billion dollars to their Rapid Housing Initiative, which promises to get modular affordable housing installed all over Canada. What was your reaction to that news?

Kevin: I was excited and, to some extent, surprised by the news. A lot of my peers in the modular industry, along with MBI, have been working diligently for a couple of years to educate CMHC and their counterparts in the US about the benefits and nuances of our modular construction methods. This early work has paid off, and I'm appreciative of the effort that went into building that relationship. I believe it's a positive step forward, and I'm excited to see how it will impact the industry.

John: It's certainly an exciting development for the modular construction industry and affordable housing efforts in Canada. With this initiative, what's it been like to navigate the process? Have you noticed any hiccups along the way?

Kevin: The timelines for this initiative are tight, and we've dedicated internal resources to help our clients navigate the application process. Since the program is relatively new, there are some challenges as CMHC works to refine it. The key is to focus on delivering projects within the 12-month timeframe, and this requires engaging all stakeholders early in the process. The sooner everyone is at the table, the better, as we have limited time to execute these projects successfully.

John: What should other modular construction companies do right now if they haven't started on their application? Are there any prerequisites they need to work through, or is there anything stopping them from getting started? What's the first step?

Kevin: The applications are open to various groups, including municipal, provincial, territorial governments, indigenous governing bodies and organizations, and non-profit organizations. The first step for other modular construction companies is to identify and reach out to potential partners among these groups who are interested in and have a need for modular construction. Educate them about the process and the triggers that need to be considered early. Engage all stakeholders as soon as possible, as it's crucial to streamline the process and meet the tight timelines.

John: That's a clear path for companies to follow. Now, let's revisit affordable housing for a moment. It's a significant issue not just in Canada but across North America. What's the best way for the industry to make noise, get in front of decision-makers, and advocate for affordable housing solutions?

Kevin: The most impactful thing the industry can do is to deliver. We need to excel on the projects we have the opportunity to work on. Demonstrating our capabilities and the value we bring to the table is crucial. If we execute these projects successfully, it speaks louder than anything we can say. Moreover, once we complete these projects, we need our clients and stakeholders to help spread the message. Client testimonials and success stories are powerful advocacy tools.

John: That's an excellent point. The industry's track record and the outcomes of these projects will speak volumes. Now, let's talk about Nomodic's recent partnerships with companies like FogBuilt and Nexi Building Solutions. What's the goal of these partnerships?

Kevin: I'm excited about these partnerships because they bring innovation and efficiency to the industry. Both FogBuilt and Nexi Building Solutions offer solutions that align with our commitment to sustainability and efficiency in construction.

FogBuilt focuses on modular interior solutions, and their approach to interiors aligns with our goal of creating sustainable and efficient modular buildings. On the other hand, Nexi Building Solutions is introducing innovative building materials and systems that enable us to optimize construction processes further. These partnerships allow us to leverage their expertise to deliver better, more sustainable, and cost-effective projects.

John: It's great to see how these partnerships can enhance the industry's capabilities. Now, you mentioned the importance of removing waste from the construction process. What are the advantages of doing that, and where does waste typically come from in construction?

Kevin: Waste in construction can manifest in various ways, including time delays, cost overruns, and excess leftover scrap materials. Removing waste from the construction process offers several advantages. Firstly, it leads to better project outcomes, such as completing projects faster and within budget. Time is critical, especially in affordable housing projects, where getting people off the streets quickly is essential.

Secondly, it benefits multiple stakeholders, from contractors to architects, engineers, and designers. When projects are efficient, everyone involved benefits, creating a positive impact throughout the construction cycle. Ultimately, the owner or end-user benefits the most, which is our primary goal in delivering affordable housing.

John: So, it's a win-win situation for all involved, and the owner benefits the most. Finally, what does 2021 look like for you, and what do you expect for the modular construction industry in Canada?

Kevin: I see 2021 as a positive step forward from this year. There's a lot of momentum in the industry, driven by initiatives like the Rapid Housing Initiative and a growing focus on social needs and sustainability. The pandemic has forced us to rethink and innovate in construction, and I believe this will lead to positive changes. Overall, I'm optimistic about the year ahead.

John: That's great to hear. Thank you so much, Kevin. It's been a pleasure speaking with you today.

Kevin: Thank you, John. I appreciate you inviting me.

Welcome, everyone! My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Gary Badge and Manny Lamarche of Florida-based design firm Fugleberg Koch. Gary and Manny are here to talk about FK's transition to new leadership and how modular design and fabrication are going to play a big role in the company's future. Gary and Manny, welcome!

Gary: Hi John, how are you doing this afternoon? We appreciate your time.

Manny: Sure, I'm doing great. I hope you guys are as well.

John: We are. I'm thrilled that you could join us today. To kick things off, Gary, could you tell me a bit about yourself and how you got into architecture?

Gary: Certainly, John. I got into architecture because it was a passion I had since my high school days. I loved building and tinkering with things, and while I was involved in athletics during my younger years, I realized that I needed something more concrete to rely on than my pitching arm. So, I decided to explore architecture, graduated from the University of Florida in 2001, and it's been an exciting journey ever since. I've worked for a few firms in South Florida and Central Florida, and I've been with Fugleberg Koch for 17 years now. It's been a homegrown journey for me, and I'm currently a principal at the firm, which is even more exciting.

John: That's excellent to hear. Manny, how about you? What's your background in architecture?

Manny: Well, I started in architecture at a relatively young age. I was 19 years old, living in South Florida, and I worked as a land surveyor and an assistant land surveyor for several years. Through that work, I started becoming more interested in how to put buildings together. After a while, I decided to go to school and earn my diploma in architecture. It's been quite a journey from there.

John: That's fascinating. Thanks for sharing. Now, tell me a bit about Fugleberg Koch. What does the firm specialize in, and what kind of services do you offer?

Gary: Fugleberg Koch, often referred to as FK, has a rich history. We've been in business for 55 or 56 years now. The firm was founded by Bob Koch and Lyle Fugleberg, and they started as a small operation in the 1960s. Over the years, the firm has grown, evolved, and survived through various economic challenges. We've always had a passion for innovation and creativity in our projects. We've worked on various sectors, including hospitality, multi-family, food and beverage, mixed-use, renovations, and more. As for the future, we believe modular construction will play a significant role in our continued success.

John: That's impressive. It sounds like FK has a wide range of experience across different sectors. Speaking of which, you mentioned your firm's interest in modular construction. What got FK interested in modular construction?

Gary: FK has always been interested in finding methods that lead to efficiencies and improvements in the design and construction process. We've always sought creative ways to expand our capabilities and provide better outcomes for our clients. With the changing landscape in construction, we recognized that modular construction could offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. So, we decided to explore modular construction as a way to integrate it into our projects and offer innovative solutions to our clients.

John: That's a great perspective. It's clear that FK sees the potential in modular construction. Now, what has been your process for learning about modular design and construction? Have there been any new techniques or processes you've had to adopt?

Manny: Learning about modular design and construction has been a multifaceted process for us. One of the significant shifts was thinking about designing for transport. In traditional construction, you don't need to consider how a building will be transported to the site. With modular, you must think about the forces of transporting a building on a flatbed truck, for instance. This has led to changes in how we approach our design grid and the parameters of designing for transport.

Another important aspect is understanding where and how connections happen in modular construction. In traditional construction, you have on-site assembly, but with modular, you need to plan for efficient assembly on-site. These considerations have informed our approach to modular design and allowed us to adapt and refine our methods.

Gary: I'd like to add that modular construction presents unique challenges and opportunities. For example, we've had to understand and communicate the benefits of modular construction to our clients. This includes educating them about the value of modular design, cost savings in the long run, and the superior quality control achieved in a factory environment.

Additionally, we've had to address concerns about who is responsible for what in modular construction. Clients often want to know when they take control of the project on-site and how much is done in the factory. This has required us to refine our communication and provide clear answers to alleviate any ambiguity.

John: It's clear that you've had to adapt and refine your processes to embrace modular design. Now, you've mentioned the challenges architects and design professionals face when embracing modular construction. Why do you think many architects and professionals in the field have been hesitant to embrace modular design fully?

Manny: I believe that reluctance to embrace modular design often stems from a fear of change. People tend to be hesitant about what they don't fully understand or what's unfamiliar to them. Traditional construction methods, like conventional framing, have been around for a long time and are well-understood. Modular construction, on the other hand, can seem like an unknown territory to many. It's important to address these misconceptions and educate professionals about the benefits and potential of modular construction.

Gary: I agree with Manny. Change is often perceived as a challenge or even a threat. People tend to stick with what they know because it's comfortable and predictable. Modular construction, being a relatively newer approach, might be intimidating to some who have been using traditional methods for years. However, with the right education and information sharing, we can help professionals see the advantages and overcome their hesitations.

John: That's a valid point. Education and information sharing are key to addressing these hesitations. Now, what can organizations like the Modular Building Institute do to help reduce these barriers for design professionals and architects in embracing modular design?

Gary: Organizations like the Modular Building Institute play a crucial role in reducing these barriers. They can continue to promote modular construction through various means, such as podcasts like this one, webinars, seminars, and networking opportunities. By providing valuable information and fostering a community where professionals can learn from one another's experiences, organizations can help architects and design professionals become more comfortable with modular construction.

Manny: I'd like to emphasize the importance of education. The more we educate ourselves about modular construction, the better equipped we'll be to educate our clients. Organizations can facilitate this by offering resources, case studies, and best practices. Additionally, events like the Modular Expo provide a platform for professionals to share their knowledge and experiences, which can be incredibly beneficial.

John: Thank you for those insights. I appreciate your perspectives on this matter. Now, can you share any details about upcoming modular projects that FK has in the pipeline? Anything particularly interesting you're working on?

Gary: We have a couple of exciting modular projects on the horizon. We're currently working with a new client that is interested in exploring modular construction. We've had initial meetings, and we're in the process of educating them about the benefits and advantages of modular construction. We believe this project could be a catalyst for further adoption of modular construction within our client's portfolio, especially in the garden-style project sector.

Additionally, we have a project out west that is considering modular construction, but with a different focus on the delivery of the project. This project involves a mixed-use environment, and we're excited to see how modular construction can fit into the broader scope of the development.

We're also working with a new client who is interested in exploring innovative approaches, including modular construction. Being at the ground floor of this collaboration is fantastic because it allows us to grow together and differentiate ourselves from the competition.

John: It sounds like you have some exciting projects ahead. We'd love to hear more about them and perhaps share some case studies in the future. Thank you both, Gary and Manny, for joining me today and sharing your insights on modular construction and FK's journey into this field.

Gary: Thank you, John. It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Manny: Yes, thank you for having us. It was great talking with you.

John: My pleasure. This has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction.

Welcome, everyone, to a new year and a new season of "Inside Modular." My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. As we all look ahead to the rest of 2021, one of the biggest things on our calendars is MBI's annual World of Modular Conference. This year's conference is scheduled for March 8th through the 12th. Because we're all still dealing with the effects of 2020, World of Modular will feel a little different this year, but we're no less excited. In fact, my guest today is Tom Hardiman, Executive Director here at the Modular Building Institute, and he's here today to talk about all the great things we've got lined up. Tom, welcome back to the podcast.

**Tom:** Hey, thanks for having me, John.

**John:** So, before we get into this year's show, for those who are new to the industry, can you describe what World of Modular is and how it came to be?

**Tom:** Sure. Well, World of Modular is really MBI's annual conference and trade show. In fact, this year is our 38th annual trade show, so it's the largest and longest-running show for commercial modular construction anywhere.

**John:** That's quite a history. Now, for those who've been attending the show for years and years, and I know there are many, let's talk about World of Modular 2021. It's going to be a different experience this year, but in many ways, it's going to be bigger and better than ever. What can you tell everyone about what's in store? And maybe you can also touch on exactly how attendees will interact in the conference itself.

**Tom:** Well, under normal circumstances, we would have been in San Diego and held this conference in person. But as you mentioned, these aren't normal circumstances. Nonetheless, we're excited about this conference because it gives us an opportunity to do things that we wouldn't be able to do in person. Just an example is the format we're using will allow you to connect with any and all attendees with just a couple of clicks of a button. That's just not something you're able to do at an in-person event. You can connect with every attendee at this conference. 

**John:** That's incredible. It sounds like the digital format has its advantages. So, let's dive into the details. How will the conference week be structured?

**Tom:** Well, we kick it off on Monday, and all times posted on the conference are Pacific times. We're doing this conference as if we were there in person. So, it'll be Monday at 11 Pacific. We'll start with our opening session and our State of the Industry presentation. That'll just give people a little highlight of what MBI accomplished in 2020 and what some of our goals and challenges are for 2021.

**John:** And I noticed that some of the times are a little irregular due to accommodating attendees from different time zones around the world.

**Tom:** That's correct. Some of the times may be a bit irregular, but we're trying to accommodate everyone around the world. We've got people in Australia, Europe, North America, so it's a bit unconventional, but there's a reason for that. It allows us to reach a global audience.

**John:** That's a smart approach. Now, after the State of the Industry, there's the annual business meeting, right? For those who haven't attended one of those meetings before, it seems like the digital format is ideal for that meeting. What can attendees expect there?

**Tom:** Yes, that's actually the main reason the association has a conference each year: that business meeting is to conduct our association's business. We elect our new board at that session. It gives members an opportunity to hear about the state of the association itself, the finances, the leadership, things like that. It's a bit of an inside look at how the organization is running.

**John:** Got it. So, beyond the opening events, this year's World of Modular is packed with speakers, as you mentioned before. What can you tell us about this year's lineup?

**Tom:** We're bringing back a crowd favorite, Anirban Basu, the Chief Economist for Associated Builders and Contractors. But we're kind of doubling up. We also have the Chief Economist for Associated General Contractors. So, if you're in the construction industry, you're going to hear from two of the leading economists in the country. Both will be at World of Modular presenting. We have keynote speaker Mark Farmer, who is a highly regarded consultant for the UK market. So, we'll have a really global presence with just the keynote speakers. But the breakout sessions, yeah, it's a who's who in the modular industry. We mentioned over 60 breakout sessions. Incredible lineup this year.

**John:** It sounds like an impressive lineup indeed. Now, one of the big draws for the conference is the presentation of our annual Awards of Distinction. These awards go to outstanding examples of modular construction in a variety of categories and serve as benchmarks for the industry. As the MC for these events, can we expect any big changes? And what's it like transitioning to a digital show for this part of the event?

**Tom:** We want to take the best of the in-person event and have a ceremony similar to what we do in person. The difference is that there will be some differences. First of all, the projects this year were phenomenal. The projects that our member companies submitted, so many good projects. So, we want to highlight all of those. It will be much easier for people to vote for their "Best of Show" entries because, again, they'll all be available there to click the button. 

Certainly, we'll give out our usual prizes. We'll induct a Hall of Fame inductee this year. We'll have our Outstanding Achievement. That'll all be virtual, but we want to make it very special this year again.

**John:** It's great to hear that you're making an effort to highlight the exceptional projects, even in a digital format. Now, another question for you: one of the main attractions at World of Modular is the exhibit hall. How will that work in a digital conference?

**Tom:** That's a great question. Everything in this conference will be available in this EventMobi platform. We will have digital expo booths. So, you'll be able to click on whichever booth you want to visit. There will be videos or documents you can download. But really, we want you to connect with those exhibitors. There'll be multiple ways for you to interact and connect with the exhibitors. You can schedule

 appointments with exhibitors. It gives you a chance really to get around and, once again, visit every booth available at World of Modular, which is probably something you could not have done in person. But the platform's there. It's literally everything's a few clicks away for you.

**John:** That's convenient. And attendees can do this on their computer, phone, tablet, or any device they prefer?

**Tom:** Absolutely. You can access it from your computer, phone, tablet, or whatever device you have.

**John:** Perfect. And there's also a grand prize this year. How will that work, and what can attendees look forward to there?

**Tom:** Well, we usually have a lot of fun with that, and Bard Manufacturing sponsors our grand prize every year for the last several years. And we make it fun. If you've been there in person, we play some games, and people are finalists. We tend to make them kind of embarrass themselves a little bit to win the prize. This year, in addition to great networking, great events, new connections, you have a chance to win ten thousand dollars that week while participating at World of Modular. Cash money. It's a great prize this year.

**John:** Cash, cash, cash. Very good. So, another question for you: for those still on the fence about attending this year's World of Modular, what's your message to them?

**Tom:** Get off the fence. In all seriousness, we have a very low attendee rate. We have a corporate pass, so if you're a member, you can pay a flat $2,500 and send as many people in your company as you want to. I just heard we had a company that is sending 50 people because at a flat $2,500, that's nothing. That's a no-brainer. This is a great opportunity to make new connections, to reconnect with some long-time friends, to learn a ton about what's going on in the industry. If you're new to modular, this is like a week-long university for you. There's no better opportunity to learn, to network. It's still the marquee event in the modular construction industry.

**John:** Thank you, Tom. I know you're busy. I appreciate your time today. As a final reminder, if you haven't registered for World of Modular, please go ahead and do that. WorldOfModular.org is the site. There are register buttons all over the place. It's going to be a great conference.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!The Potential of Automation in the Modular Construction Industry w/ Brave Control Solutions

John McMullen

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.
Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Brent McPhail of Brave Control Solutions. Brent is here to talk about the role of automation in the construction industry, and specifically how it can be applied to modular construction. Brent, welcome to the podcast.

Brent McPhail

Good morning, John. How are you today?

John McMullen

I am very well how are you?

Brent McPhail

I'm doing pretty good.

John McMullen

Excellent. So let's dive right in. Tell me about yourself Brent. What's your background and what's the genesis of Brave Control Solutions?

Brent McPhail

Sure. So, I’m Canadian and grew up in southwestern Ontario, on a small farm. I had an entrepreneurial background and some small businesses before I was even 16 years old. I went away to college, took a technology program. Basically, it was electrical engineering technology, where we learned how to program mechatronics systems and from there moved on to beginning a career automating processes in the automotive industry. Now, the genesis of Brave back in 2008, I decided to go off on my own and start my own engineering company called Brave Control Solutions, named after my two kids, Bryson and Avery. Coincidentally, the name Brave also signifies courage, which we tend to take a lot of weird sort of tough challenges, tight timelines, things that maybe a lot of my competition don't necessarily want to try to tackle. That's sort of what's landed us here in looking at the offsite and modular construction industry and the automation requirements.

John McMullen

Very good. As you mentioned, Brave is in Canada, but you're actually only a few minutes from Detroit. Is that right?

Brent McPhail

That's right. So, when you talk automation, and you talk historically, I always say that within 150 miles of the Ambassador Bridge, which is the bridge between Windsor and Detroit, which is the largest volume commercial border crossing in the world. We do more automation within 150 miles of that bridge than anywhere on the planet. So, when you look at the history of the automotive in both Canada, United States, a lot of that manufacturing originated right here. Along with that came the supporting industries, and just in Windsor alone, there's 300 companies that do what I do. In Detroit, there's 3000. So, there's certainly a lot of automation experience within this 150 mile radius.

John McMullen

Nice. So here's an obvious question, but I think it'll help us get the ball rolling a little bit. In a nutshell, what's the advantage of automation?

Brent McPhail

Well so keep in mind John you're speaking to a guy who designs, builds and sells automated systems. I would ask the question of what's not an advantage?

John McMullen

Well, we can do that too.

Brent McPhail

Yeah, but the thing is, that really automation in 2021, it's used to empower people. Historically, automation has got a bad rap of taking jobs. I remember my early days, you'd install a robot in a place and the workers would come in, and they'd say, hey, that robot’s name is Bob. Right away, you'd know, oh, Bob was the name of the guy who used to do that job. I would always say to them, look, guys, my robots don't take jobs. My robots help companies be more efficient and more effective. They help companies be safer, they help them be more efficient, they help them be more productive, so that they can hire more Bob's to put in other areas where Bob's are supposed to be used. So, the biggest thing that I'll always say about automation and empowering automation, that's the term I call automating responsibly, and the biggest thing that I always say about that is the human being is the best robot possible that there could ever be for flexible situations. Robots are really good at repetitive, dirty, unsafe, heavy areas of a manufacturing process.

The key is, make sure that you've got your robots doing the jobs that robots are supposed to do and your humans doing the job that humans are supposed to do and you've got a great automated process. So, that's kind of in a nutshell, my sort of higher level view on automating any processes that there's opportunities everywhere. You just got to be careful to make sure that you're applying it in the right way.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So historically with the construction industry, even with modular construction and prefabrication which is known really for speedier processes and time savings, the adoption of automation has really been pretty slow. Why is that?

Brent McPhail

So that is actually a really good question. One of the first things that struck me back in 2018, as we started to look at our first modular construction problem. I have a little analogy now. This is two and a half years later, or three years later, almost. So, I have a story that I tell to sort of explain it. So, I call it my F150 story. When we first started looking at this, and when you think about an F150, F150 is a very complicated piece of equipment, let's say there's 10,000 different variants, when you consider all the paint options, interior options, motor options, wheel options, and everything that's involved. It's a very sophisticated piece of equipment, but there's one rule that is always true with an F150. That is it and all of its options are 100% known before you build a factory to build a million of them, and also build one every 54 seconds. So, when we started doing our first project in modular, the company came to us and said, hey, we've got 150 different modules that we need to build in this automated system. We looked at it and said, Okay, 150 modules, that's quite a few, but there's probably only really about 12 to 15 major variations, and then there's some minor variations. So that's not too bad, we can handle that.

As we started into our design, they came to us and said, Hey, good news, guys. We want another building. Of course, my team was like, Yeah, that's great news. This is really going to take off. I said, okay, so as soon as all of the architects have designed the new modules, we'll send them off to you guys, you can build on your machine. That's when everybody in my team went, oh, wait a second, guys. It doesn't work that way. You can't send us things to build in our machine after we've already built the machine. That's just not how automation works. Fortunately, or unfortunately, this company said to us, well, that's the machine we bought, so you guys are going to have to figure it out. Effectively, that's what we've done. So, as I now look back and I look at the automation industry and the construction industry knowing that automation, computer controller automation has been around since the late 60s. Yet there's next to no adoption in the construction industry. What strikes me is it's not the construction industry’s issue. It's the automation industries issue.

That analogy where when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Well, what that means is the guys that are sitting in my seat, keep going to the construction guys and saying no, you don't understand, you've got to build your products more consistent, you've got to build them like an F150. But the construction guys are saying, well, you don't understand, our customers don't want to buy products like that. They want the variability; they want the flexibility in it. So, the real challenge with automating in the construction industry is automation has to be able to provide the flexibility, but it's impossible to provide complete flexibility. On the other hand, construction needs to get some standardization in place so that where we meet in the middle will be where we can do a really good automated integrated project.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So let's talk about the advantages of automation, specifically, for the modular industry. Are there some examples that you give me about how automation could benefit a modular manufacturer?

Brent McPhail

Oh, for sure, yeah. So, what I'm basically saying is I work with my clients in the stages of automation companies. So, a modular company that has no automation, it would be a bit of a risk for them to put in a fully integrated system. But there's a lot of stuff that you can do before that. So, we've got some stuff we're calling Build Tech, intelligence around, helping to kick things, make decisions, track product. These are tools that are already available prior to Brave entering the market. One of the biggest advantages I think that Brave brings, because we're an automation company not a software company, we're the group that helps bridge like that touching. So, we take the digital and we touch the product with it. We push that up to the digital so we can give a better layer of integration there. You move from that to a next level of automation, which would be some smart tools, but that aren't necessarily a programmable tool. So, there's some products that are available, we're developing some of our own but to help prep material, cut material, sort of do one or two steps in a process to make it a little bit simpler.

Then you go to stage three, which would be a programmable or like a smart jig. Something that maybe helps with some air proofing take some of the challenge of setting up new equipment as you as you have your variation of products. Then you move all the way to the end which is like a fully integrated product. So, in the modular industry we're doing, some of the machines that we built right now are for precision fabrication. So, we're welding the steel chassis together. We're building wooden cassettes, they call them panel walls, things of that nature. So, the biggest thing is, there's low hanging fruit in every modular factory that I've seen so far. It’s just about doing a discovery and understanding where some of the challenges are, that are the right size for the client, what their technical capability is at this exact moment, and sizing them up with a piece of automation that can help them.

John McMullen

Gotcha. You alluded to this some in your previous answer, but I'll ask anyway. Are there some specific portions of the modular construction process that benefit most from automation?

Brent McPhail

Yeah. What I would say is, generally speaking humans are the most sophisticated robot there is. There is a nice little story I say. You don't have to program a human when he's working next to another human to see that human on fire, and him just automatically go and grab a fire extinguisher. But you could have two robots working side by side, one of them burning up and the other one just keeps working. It's funny, but that's the reality. A robot does what it's directed to do. The best situations for a robot are things that are sort of heavy and dirty. When you think about a welding robot, welding is something that in the automotive industry we know how to do very well, it requires a skill. A robot can basically do that type of thing, repetitively, quite easily. The other thing I do want to stress as well, robots are the fun thing to talk about in automation, but really, there's so much automation that happens that doesn't have anything to do with the robot. Material handling, moving things around, just using some software intelligence to help make better decisions. That's part of the roadmap that you'd expect to see as well. As soon as you're going from no automation to fully integrated, you want to have a good balance of robotic automation, but also just normal automation without robotics. So, there's kind of two sides to it.

John McMullen

Gotcha. You mentioned in your answer systems intelligence. Tell me, just for the uninitiated, a little bit more about how robots, and I'll use that simple term, can use their systems intelligence to make decisions. What variables can they see, deal with and make decisions about?

Brent McPhail

Okay, so actually, you maybe aren't going to be asking for technical answers I'll give you here. So, I'll try to keep it high level, but robots don't necessarily make a decision other than what they've been programmed or directed to do. So that's maybe one of the misconceptions about a robot. People talk about artificial intelligence, but it's still quite a ways away, except for maybe a few small applications. What we're talking about is a robot can only do as it's directed or has been pre conditioned to do. So, the job of a system integrator, such as Brave, is to examine the entire world of the process that we're looking at and pre anticipate all of the potential decisions that will need to be made. Then, we give the robot options to deal within those. It is about a question and why I say a human is a much more sophisticated robot because humans have that intuitive thinking. They can do that type of work on their own.

One of the challenges that we find in automating a system is that if you try to model a robot after a human exactly the way a human operates, you're going to fail because the human is so sophisticated in what they can do with their vision system, which we call eyes. I don't want to talk too much like a nerd, but you know what I mean? What we have to do is make sure that we have the 20 years experience in automating automotive manufacturing, to look at the challenges right off the bat. I think a lot of people when they sort of see the high level, the glossy brochure of what automation can do in the construction industry, they're like, okay, I want a robot to do that. We quickly look at and go, no, guys, that's not your low hanging fruit right there, that's going to cause you nothing but problems. However, if we simplify this down, we can find an ROI for you using a robot or some other type of automation over here, that's going to pay itself back and everybody's going to be happy. It's going to increase your automation IQ and get you ready for a more sophisticated solution as we go.

John McMullen

Tell me about the adoption process for manufacturer when it comes to automation. Can they phase aspects of it in or does it need to be done all at one time?

Brent McPhail

Yeah, so that's actually a really good question. It’s something that's come up with our experience and something we're working on with some clients right now. What I would say is that there's probably two different approaches to take. You know, if you are a modular company and you are looking to go from zero to 100%, a fully automated facility, a fully automated plant, then there's a process to do that. There's a methodology that we can take, you know, three years to do that. What I think the majority that we've been running across so far are people that already have some form of manufacturing, or offsite construction going on and they're looking to try to increase their automation IQ. So what we're finding with these guys is, a phased in approach is absolutely the best way, but it's more than just a phase of the technology. The real challenge of the underlying challenges is that there's a manufacturing organizational structure that happens in a manufacturing plant, such as Ford, and this organizational structure has been in play for 60 years.

Well, what we have to admit was that when we walk into a, I'll say, construction or modular construction facility, we see a factory, you know, I see a factory. But what I'm, what we miss a lot of times are some of the specific roles, process engineering, maintenance, engineering, you know, industrial engineering, things of this nature, that are crucial in the success of an automated facility but aren't necessarily needed when you're building an offsite construction facility that doesn't have automation in it. And so why that's so crucial. Crucial is, we have to intentionally help our clients get that level of intelligence, when it comes to the actual sort of administrative skills.

The analogy I always use is, you know, you, you, everybody loves babies, and, but we know, every morning, when a baby wakes up, it should have diaper, and you've got to change that diaper. And automation is like that, in a lot of ways, automation, robots will catch themselves on fire pull their wires out. But what happens is, once we once we love that automation, and once we have preventative maintenance in place, and we have spare parts in place, and we have the technicians required to, you know, to make sure that that stuff can work efficiently, you know, the ROI, including all of that is still there. But it's something that it's not intuitive, right? It's one of those things is logical, but not intuitive. And so the job of a consultant like myself, is to is to help bring that in with intention. So, but certainly phasing it in, you know, getting the, you know, a building upon, you know, one technology on top of the next and also changing around the manufacturing organizational structure is, you know, the kind of the ways you've got to get there.

John McMullen

Is there, is there a timeline that you generally work with or recommend? Or have seen other manufacturers? Sort of adopt, in aggregate, I suppose, is it? Is it a years of five years? Is it six months? What have you seen?

Brent McPhail

So, so, you know, what timeline is a great question. And because, you know, we're relatively new on our pivot from automotive manufacturing, or automotive automation to construction, you know, we haven't gone through enough iterations of this for me to answer that. But I will say that there is certainly one very crucial component, when it comes to timeline, and that is this automation, for the most part, we're not selling a coffeemaker we're not selling a photocopier. So meaning we don't have an inventory of these things sitting on the shelf. And when you decide this time is right to purchase, you just come and buy it, and away you go.

When we're selling an integrated solution, even if it's based on an architecture that we've already made many times, there's still a, you know, a customization, there's still tooling that needs to be designed things need to be fabricated. So the common thing that we hear a lot of times is, you know, speaking with a client, and they'll say, "Yeah, okay, we want to just kind of touch base with you right now. But, you know, we're not going to be ready for automation until next year. And so but we just want to start to, you know, get a feeling or an understanding of some ideas." And we look at them and say, "Guys, you could be anywhere from six to 18 months, from the time we go through a discovery process with you, you know, put a proposal together, simulate it, validate it, start building, fabricating, run it off and buy it off in our facility and ship it to your facility. Depending on the sophistication, it could be six to 18 months."

And so, you know, with that in mind, when should we be talking about what you're trying to automate? Right? So the thing about automation is, it'll never happen. From a design standpoint as quickly I think, as you know, the customer wants to. And that's just something to note.

John McMullen

All right, let's, I'm glad I asked them. Speaking of design, it leads me to my next question. Are there design considerations that other professionals in the modular industry and I'm talking about architects and structural engineers, are there other design considerations that they would have to consider when working with an automated process?

Brent McPhail

Yeah, so with the automated process, basically, the word that we use is, you know, the product has to speak to the automation. And so simply what that means is, you know, a structural engineer, an architect, they can design a module and in a lot of different ways, ways that I don't even fully understand, but I'm just starting to learn but so, but we have limitations and constraints in our automation.

And so what the trade off is, is, can we automate a process 100% Yes, but it has to be a very rigid process. So In the levels of flexibility that we're talking, we might only be able to automate 75 80% we have, you know, a robot arm that's doing material handling, maybe a foot wide. And so if an architect doesn't realize this, and he designs, you know, spacing between two, two joints or two supports that are less than a foot, well, you've already run into a collision that the robot can operate. In reality, it's, it's probably more than a foot not not probably definitely more than a foot because you've got other clearances and other issues at play. So one of the things again, that, you know, we sort of take for granted in the automotive industry is, there's this tribal knowledge about how to manufacture, tooling, and parts.

And so when you look at a vehicle being built, you'll see the product, you know, if you, if you open up the door, your car and you look inside, you see the supporting structure in there, you'll see lots of little like dimples and holes and other things that have really no bearing on the actual car product itself. Well, those are all things that are made to assist at some point in the manufacturing process. And so the interesting thing about the automotive industry is, that's sort of like a tribal knowledge, or they just, they know that they pass it down, senior designers teach Junior designers, hey, you have to have a locating point here, you have to have a clearance here. So the robot tooling can pick this up. Well, we're not at that point yet in this industry. And so one of the ways that we're trying to compensate for that is by building what we call a digital factory. So it's a digital representation of the actual machine. And then that way, we give the architects the ability to see it with their own eyes. So as they're designing their product, they can run some tests on their product. And they can actually see this thing as though they're sitting right next to a machine. And so that's how we're going to evolve, you know, their choices and their decisions, and their designs that they're making to help it speak to the automation.

So that's a really good question, John, because that's a very...what we see sort of coming down the pipe is the next sort of big thing. Once we can get you know, more and more of these, more and more of these guys using automation. That'll be the next big thing is the design.

John McMullen

So what's your pitch to those considering automation? How do you describe the ROI?

Brent McPhail

Okay, so the pitch, I guess, or what I would say is, it's this thing, like you don't know what you don't know. So every facility that I walked through, I see things happening, that I go home, guys, like, you can't build it this way. They also look at what I'm building and it and they say, Oh, we didn't know that you had this flexibility. So we have this huge gap right now between the understanding of what the requirements are on a offsite construction, you know, facility, and what we can do. So what we've been doing our pitches, we need to do a discovery. And the discovery always works, where we have potential problems with low hanging fruit ROI, my engineering team, and their manufacturing teams sit together, they vet those out, we build simulations, so that everything is very visible, so they can see what it looks like. And then we just have open discussions.

So what we do in that discovery is we first, you know, we identify the problem, then we define it, then we propose a solution. And then we build the solution. And it's amazing how that path takes us. But along with that are, you know, these two things, I always say it's this ROI value based, you know, solutioning approach. And so what I mean by that is, if I can't find an ROI on a piece of equipment that has a payback, that the person who's going to buy that equipment is, except then we're wasting our time. And number two, if I were to say, okay, so your payback is two and a half years. All right, so let's do a billion dollars. And it'll pay itself back in two and a half years. But it's also not practical, because there's always the risk component, you know, what someone's prepared, prepared to put up. So what I will always say is, as we're doing the discovery, part of the discovery is, you know, what is your budget? What is your payback? And then we go through and figure out, Okay, what are the cost inputs? Like, you know, where are your costs being lost?

Once we understand that, and we can quantify that, then we go ahead, and we can put together a piece of, you know, simulated automation, and we can then definitively say, look, all the risks have been identified, and proven that the risks are not here, as far as a lot of the risks come with, like the material handling, or the fastening technology, whatever it might be. And then we look at the, you know, the cost and the production throughput, and all that type of stuff and say, Look, the business cases here and the technologies here, you know, let's go. So that's my pitch is there's not a lot that we can do at this stage without doing a discovery and working together to try to understand the core of the problem and then put together a solution.

John McMullen

That makes sense. So what's next for BCS? What are your goals in the next five years?

Brent McPhail

So now you're going to catch me talking to the other side of my mouth. So my goal is to identify those project builders problems, the more folks that I'm speaking with, the more I'm seeing sort of some consistent trends in some of the challenges that they're facing. And the more I do believe that we have the ability to make some standard products. So as much as I say, what we don't do is make a coffeemaker or a photocopier. Wouldn't it be cool if we were making photocopiers or coffee makers that we could just basically say, Here, take this and plug this in, and this will get you your first step. So the next five years, we've got our CAD path product currently, but we're developing some other products as well. So that's sort of on one vertical.

And then on the other vertical, we are building a system to basically assist the other side of the spectrum, which is the modular guy who wants to go from zero to 100. So when I say how can we intentionally get you there, what we're doing is we're building the intentional system, I kind of name it, you know, I sound like it's like a rocket launching. So you know, you've got your, you got your lift off. But if you work backwards, you know, t minus 18 months, bring in a, you know, HR, recruiting person, t minus 16 months, you know, bringing your manufacturing engineering, you know, and sort of we're we're, we're putting together our best brains from a manufacturing standpoint, and trying to build out this intentional process to be able to assist in setting up a factory from zero to 100%.

John McMullen

Why I just wanted to thank you for your time today, Brent, this has really been a learning experience. For me, it's a fascinating look into a fast growing portion of this industry. So I appreciate your time. Thank you.

Brent McPhail

Yeah, yeah, you know, what, thanks for having me. And, you know, this is it's, it's very exciting for us to be a part of this, you know, I, for years, we basically had a company that its sole purpose is to increase shareholder value for automotive plants, you know, we find our ways to, you know, make ourselves happy by the new technologies we introduce and whatnot. But truly, at the end of the day, that's what it was. And the thing that has so excited about being a part of this offsite construction industry, is that there is a global labor shortage, there is a global housing crisis. And so we feel that we now can use our technology to really impact something much bigger than our shareholders. Now, for all the business owners out there, don't get me wrong. We're still trying to impact the shareholders as well. But but but basically, it's just it's a really, it's very exciting for us as well to be a part of this industry. So...

John McMullen

Well, thanks. And you guys are new MBI members, I believe, right?

Brent McPhail

We are correct. Yep. And actually, I'm going to be speaking at the show the World of Modular virtual show. Some more, some, some more topics about this coming up, so very good.

John McMullen

Very good. And thanks for thanks for coming on. And thanks for presenting at World of Modular. We're always happy to talk to a presenter and we're very excited about that show ourselves. So thanks again. My name is John McMullen. This has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Success in Salt Lake City: How the Adoption of New Modular Construction Standards in Utah Could Affect the Entire Country

John McMullen

Hello, and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined again by Jon Hannah-Spacagna, MBI’s Government Affairs Director. He's here to share some breaking news out of Salt Lake City, and to help us all understand what it could mean for the modular industry around the country. Jon, welcome back.

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Thanks for having me. Nice to be back.

John McMullen

So, let's get right to it. What can you tell me about what happened in Salt Lake City last night?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Well, it was a historic moment for us as a modular industry. Just a quick backstory. A few months ago, I was approached by some of our members who were working on a large project in Salt Lake City and had run into some barriers there because Salt Lake City did not have a modular program for anything that was built outside of the city limits. So, I started working with the building official, there Orion Goff, and we were able to present them with a working document that is soon to become an anti-standard of how to adopt a modular program for a city or state that doesn't have one. So last night at 9:53, Eastern Standard Time, this city council voted unanimously to adopt our proposal, and to be implemented immediately, which not only will benefit this project, but others in the future in the city. So, we're very thankful for their partnership and very grateful that now our industry has a huge city of over a million people that we now have access to.

John McMullen

That's fantastic and thanks for the late night. I know you had to stay up on that call. The adoption of these standards, does that pave the way for just a particular type of modular construction or is everything on the table now?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Yeah, everything's on the table now. It’s modular, whether it's relocatable, whether it’s permanent, it really opens up the whole door for our industry now in Salt Lake City, which is just fantastic.

John McMullen

So, tell me more about MBI’s partnership with the ICC. I know they were integral in forming these standards. How long have these standards been in the works and more importantly, why do they matter?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

So, our executive director, Tom Hardiman, has been part of a working committee now for probably about a year in working on this standard. So, this committee is put together by people in the industry that work with the ICC to make sure that they get the standard, right. So, it's now in the final phases, it just finished the second public comment period. What these standards do specifically for our industry, is allow us to open up markets like Salt Lake City, that don't have a program and aren't sure how to go about adopting one. So, this really gives them a plug and play guideline and soon to be standard that they can say, hey, we want to start a modular program. Here's the nuts and bolts of how you do that. So, it really is something that we hope to take and replicate throughout the country, just like Salt Lake City has practically already done.

John McMullen

Nice. For those who may not be as familiar with the ICC, or the International Code Council, who are they exactly and how does their work impact the modular construction industry?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

So, they set the building codes for everyone internationally. Then it's up to the states and cities to adopt them as they see fit. So, they're put out every three years, but it's up to the states and cities to adopt what they feel is comfortable, add amendments, things that may be specific to their area, whether it's for seismic issues or snow weight, things like that. Essentially, it gives them a guideline to adopt, so that all the buildings that are built are built to those codes. So, for modular specific we’re built to the code just like any other building would be, whether it's modular or regular construction, and it allows us to have a guide so that our folks that are building all over the country know what they need to build too as far as following the standard guidelines.

John McMullen

Very good. So, let's turn back to Salt Lake City for a moment. Now that the city council has agreed to adopt these modular friendly standards. What's next?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

So, we're working with Salt Lake City right now. We’re planning to do a town hall with their building official Orien Golf to help our members understand as they implement this process, as we have many members that are anxious to get into Salt Lake City and Salt Lake City as a great need for new construction, whether it's for affordable housing or other needs. It allows more members to get in touch with them and understand the process, but also this will allow us to take this model that has yet to be published, which is somewhat unprecedented and go to other cities that are in the same need and say, look, here's what was done in Salt Lake City, here's a path for you to implement your own program, which is going to open up just numerous opportunities for our industry to continue to grow and have a guideline and a standard to work from.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So, the really the big takeaway for other cities, it sounds like now there's a plan. Now, there's a model that I can work from if I'm a city and I don't have a modular program. Now there's one to look to.

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Exactly. For a city the size of Salt Lake City to do this proactively before the standards have been published, speaks volumes to the work of like I said, Orion Goff in the city council to be proactive in seeing the vision and the opportunity with modular construction, and be willing to adopt these guidelines before they're even published.

John McMullen

Very nice. So, not only are we excited by this news, but there's really a whole lot going on in the world of government affairs, including a town hall that you're hosting tomorrow, in fact. What can you tell me about that?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Yeah, so we're hosting a town hall tomorrow with our Washington, DC lobbyists. That's Max Perkins and Justin Lewis and we'll be talking about all things that's going on at the federal level. We now have a new Congress, we have a new leader in the White House, we also have new cabinet members that are over seeing things like Department of Labor, FEMA, HUD. So, all these areas directly impact our industry. Even though we've already built relationships with folks that are still in those areas, but with the new Congress and the White House, in their agendas there could be things that roll out that impact our industry, both on a positive level, but also things we may need to work hard to defeat or to curb their impact on our industry to allow us to continue to grow. So, there'll be given us a full perspective of what have we seen so far and what to expect in 2021.

John McMullen

Very good. For those who can't join tomorrow's town hall, you're also presenting at the upcoming World of Modular. What will that presentation cover?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Yeah. So, we have our DC lobbyists will be part of that panel, along with myself, and then our New York lobbyist, as well as our California lobbyists. So, we'll be giving a perspective in each of those areas of things we're working on. We'll have a better idea of bills that will be coming out as California's last day to submit bills as this Friday. So, we'll be able to give an update on things we're working on in those specific areas, but also things outside of that, that we're working on that are more specific to certain states or cities that we're having conversations with, that are opening their doors to the modular industry.

John McMullen

You mentioned a town hall about Salt Lake City that that will be occurring a little bit later this year. What else have you got going on?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Well, this has already been a busy year for us, which is somewhat, I think, a benefit of last year that we really built a strong foundation and took the opportunity we had. Through the unfortunate things of the pandemic, it really brought to light the advantages that we could do in modular. So, we've been able to take that and grow that already this year, with opportunities we've had in Canada with a billion dollars being given to the modular industry for affordable housing. Taking those wins that we've had, and now grow them in 2021, with conversations with cities like San Jose, with the state of California with New York City. So we're building on those conversations, but we're also seeing things that we're having to defend our industry on, with bills that have already come out in New York, that would be very derogatory to our industry requiring prevailing wage union labor contracts. Similar things in California, and then also at the federal level with the Proact, which could impact our industry greatly. So even though we're having to play a little more defense this year than we have in the past, we're also continuing to push things forward and open up new markets like we did with Salt Lake City.

John McMullen

Very nice. Well Jon, I appreciate your time. One last thing, if anyone has any questions about government affairs, Salt Lake City, or any of the initiatives that MBI is working on, how should they get in touch?

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Yeah, just email me at jon@modular.org and I’d be glad to answer any questions at all. I'll say if they start to see things out there that may be going sideways on a project or a state or a city, the sooner I can get involved, the more I can have a quicker impact. The Salt Lake City issue we got involved a year after it started. Within a few months, we're able to have success. So, if you see something out there and you need our help, just let us know and we're here for you.

John McMullen

Very good. As always, we'll keep our events page on modular.org updated with townhall information. So, invite people to keep their eyes on that page and it sounds like it's going be a busy year. I'm looking forward to it.

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Yeah, absolutely. Last thing I'll say if you’re a member of MBI and you're not participating in our seals program, the purchase of those seals is what allows us to have lobbyists like we have in New York, California, DC, in areas that may come up that we're not expecting yet. So, I encourage you to support our sales program. It's on our website, on our member page. I encourage you to do that. Also, if you haven't signed up yet for World of Modular March 8 through 12th, now's a great time to do that as well.

John McMullen

Looking forward to that as well. Thanks again, Jon. I appreciate your time.

Jon Hannah-Spacagna

Thank you, John.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.The Challenge—And Value—Of Proper Modular Window Installation w/ WinTech

John McMullen

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome everyone my name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Chesney Beck, Vice President of Sales and Engineering at WinTech. Chesney is here to talk about the value and challenges of proper window installation and about wind Tech's new modular installation certification program. Chesney, welcome.

Chesney Beck

Thank you very much. I appreciate you having me on the podcast. I will say Inside Modular has been a great resource and very much enjoyed listening over the last few months. So, it's a pleasure to be here.

John McMullen

Oh, well, flattery is a great way to start an episode. So, thank you very much. It's not often that I speak with the Vice President of Sales and Engineering. Tell me a little bit about your background Chesney.

Chesney Beck

Sure, absolutely. So, sales and engineering, it's a bit of a strange marriage combination. So, I actually get that comment from time to time. I will say that I've been very blessed to really enjoy kind of the balance between the technical side of what I get to do and then the relationship side of the business that's come with the sales piece. Combining the two has been very rewarding for me thus far. To dig into my background just a little bit. I'm a structural engineer by trade, and education have worked as a practicing engineer for probably six plus of the 19 years that I've been out of college and in the workforce. During those six plus years, I would say my primary focus has been within the window and fenestration industry. With the remainder of the time, I did have a small handful of years where I designed commercial structures as an engineering consultant. Over the past 13 years or so, my career has really evolved more towards the focus on the business management side. I've had just a great opportunity to lead several engineering, quality, estimating, project management, customer service teams, which has been extremely rewarding.

As you mentioned, my current role is Vice President of Sales and Engineering for WinTech out of Bonet, Missouri. I'm responsible for several aspects of the front end of our business, which would range everywhere from sales and marketing, through the estimating customer service piece and into product design and research and development. So that's kind of a little bit of a high-level picture of my background, if you will.

John McMullen

Very nice. For those who aren't familiar with WinTech, what do you guys do?

Chesney Beck 

Yeah, so ultimately, WinTech is a building material supplier to the construction industry. Now I get that that's a very general sweeping statement. We've got several different products that we provide to several different markets. We've got a very strong focus on window products, but we span a lot of different areas. Currently, our organizational structure is broken down into six different corporate divisions that kind of serve the various markets that we play in. From a listing standpoint, those divisions include a residential division, which consists primarily of vinyl window products that we provide to a below grade or basement residential market. We have a commercial division, where we provide aluminum and vinyl commercially rated windows into commercial markets. Examples of those kinds of projects would include multifamily housing, student housing or university type work, assisted living, hospital work, hospitality work, that that kind of stuff.

We also have a light commercial division that focuses a lot of products in the pre-engineered metal building and pole barn markets. We have a door and panel division that currently focuses on supplying insulated doors and panels to hvac market and a few other niche markets in that area. We've got a louvers and grills division, that division really provides a lot of P tech louvers to the hospitality window world. And then finally, the modular division, which we'll be talking about quite a bit today, is where we provide various products to both the relocatable as well as the permanent modular construction sector so that that's kind of who we are from a product standpoint, from a cultural perspective. We were 100% employee owned as an Aesop located in southwest Missouri so we kind of feel like we have those Midwest values that kind of match the region that we're in. And, you know, as far as a focus on competing, we compete with quality delivery and then services that we offer both before and after the sale. So that's kind of a big picture of what WinTech is all about.

John McMullen

Well, thank you so help me understand some of the specifics about windows and window installation specifically when it comes to modular construction. How does that process differ from traditional installations?

Chesney Beck

Sure, yeah, great question. I'm going to try not to get too geeky, but I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about windows here. Sometimes that's a little bit of a danger with me being an engineer and a window guy. So, speaking at a high level. So, I'm just going to talk about windows for a brief second. When we talk about windows, very seldom, are we actually talking about what I would consider to be just the window product. So, if we're talking windows, quality issues, whatever the case may be, it's typically the window system that's being discussed as the true scope. To break down what I mean by the window system in this context, includes not only the window product itself, but also the installation of that window into the surrounding conditions or the supporting structure.

So, you've got the window piece, which if you just look at the window, it can actually be a fairly complex product. You've got frame and sash materials that could be vinyl or aluminum, steel, wood, fiberglass, a whole bunch of different options. You've got glass, that can be different colors, and low E coatings, insulated glass versus non insulated glass, different thicknesses, so on and so forth. You got different ways of holding the glass to the frame, whether it's tape applied or sealed, different hardware options, different operations, attachment methods, finishes all of this stuff that can create the window. Then conversely, you have the installation piece, which is also complex. You've got the flashing and the wrapping that goes into the opening. You've got the ceiling of the window, ensuring the window is installed square, and plumb the attachment of the window to the structure, all of these things. So, between the window, which is fairly complex, and the installation, which is also fairly complex, you have this overall system. The integrity of which completely depends on all of those items being correct and performed correctly.

When this is done correctly, you've got a window that looks good functions well, it doesn't leak air or water, it does what it's supposed to do, you don't even hardly notice it, except for you look at it every day and it's a beautiful operating thing. When done incorrectly, you notice it big time. You’ve got windows that leak, you got installation leaks, can develop hot or cold spots, it’s ugly, it doesn't operate correctly, all of those things.

So, all of these things kind of have to work together in order to have this true window system. WinTech, it's our responsibility to make sure that that product meets the customer's requirements. Then, you got the modular factory’s responsibility to ensure that the installation meets their customer's requirements. So, as you hear me talk about the window, or the window system, that kind of stuff, I kind of wanted to talk about a little bit of the terminology piece there and what that means.

Now to get back to your question of modular versus on site. So, bringing this back to that on the modular from the modular perspective efficiency is a huge emphasis when it comes to the overall construction priority list. Efficiency is very high on the list. Modular factories are focused on ensuring that they can properly install the product, whether it be a window, or all of the other associated products in that modular unit in a very timely manner and done correctly and done quickly. So that's one difference is that they're really focused on that efficiency piece. Transportation is another major difference between modular and on-site construction. With onsite construction, the materials are all delivered individually to the jobsite, and then they're all assembled put together on site in that kind of standard construction method. With modular, all those materials are brought into the modular factory, and assembled there at the modular factory and then transported to the job site as a unit or an assembly.

So, let's say you had potential quality issues or things that were just on the verge of being an issue, that transportation piece can actually magnify some of those problems if not taken care of properly during the construction phase. One last difference is the relatively old standardized sizes of windows that that we find in modular units, especially on the relocatable modular sector. This really allows us to provide good stocking agreements with our modular customers, which can result in just very quick turnaround and lead times for the factories. So those are some of the differences that we see between the onsite and the modular piece.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, you touched on this with your response just now with the transportation issue, but have you noticed any challenges when it comes to supplying for modular manufacturers? As a supplier how have you been addressing those?

Chesney Beck 

Yeah, so another great question. So admittedly challenges do arise, they arise both in modular and onsite construction. Frankly, at the high level, a lot of those challenges are fairly similar. In general, both markets require that high quality product delivered properly, delivered on time, excellent services, they want help, and they need help before and after the sale. So, we certainly focus on those items across the board. One of the largest challenges that we see is simply ensuring that that entire window system that I got through talking about probably too much previously, just making sure that an entire window system, product and the installation work together to ensure that you've got an air and watertight system, especially when these pieces are owned by two completely different teams. One being the manufacturer of the of the product, which would be us, and then the other being the modular factory in this case. So, one of the items that we've done here recently, in order to get that product and installation piece to be as seamless of a system as possible, we have developed a modular installation certification program, that we're actually going to be offering modular factories, and rolling out in the World of Modular which is occurring next month, as I'm sure you know.

So little bit of a description of this modular installation certification program. The purpose of this certification program is kind of twofold. Number one, it provides the onsite training, to the modular factories, to ensure they fully understand the installation of our products, how to handle our products, it's a true product training piece for them. Secondly, it provides the modular factories downstream customers with a bit of an assurance that when it comes to the proper installation of the window products, that they have stepped through a true training and a true audit process for that. So, it's kind of twofold from a purpose standpoint. For those that are going to be enrolled in the certification program, WinTech would be providing an annual onsite training. This is, it's done at the modular factory. That said, if, frankly, were a little bit open to you know, if they would like to come into our facility, that training could take place here as well. But it's true on site, hands on training, with factory specific, engineers and technical folks.

Training topics would include things like best practices for wrapping the window, opening, waterproofing, window product and handling training, window installation training, sealing, troubleshooting all things windows, if you will. We would also be providing essentially a consulting service to the modular factory for anybody enrolled in this program. Ultimately, that consulting service is all about making sure that they have the true line to us for discussing special installation issues, custom installations, general questions that they may have, we want to be sure that we provide a technical service to them to say, if you've got anything you want to talk about, please give us a call. Then we provide essentially a letter of certification to the modular factory, that they can then supply replace in their submittal packages to their downstream customers, as well as using any marketing efforts that they may have. The final kind of piece of the puzzle, from a requirement standpoint, is an annual onsite audit. So, we want to make sure that we are taking a look at the ways, the methods that the windows are being installed to simply ensure that the window installation is completed per the installation instructions and best practices in this onsite audit, frankly, it's another great point of contact between the modular factory of WinTech where any questions they have can be answered, solutions can be explored. It's just another opportunity for communication between the two. From an eligibility standpoint, all modular factories are eligible to request the certification. Then, from a cost standpoint, we are currently offering this at no cost to the modular factory, it's just a service or piece that we feel would be a great improvement for the overall system.

John McMullen

Nice. So, let's pretend that I'm a manufacturer or factory owner, what's the biggest benefit of getting my factory certified?

Chesney Beck

Sure. I see two or three benefits here. The first being them having access to or us providing them with that knowledge and information just direct from the manufacturer. When it comes to the products that they're holding in their hands that they're installing into their modular units, if they want to know anything about that product, getting that information direct from the manufacturer is key. So, it really provides that knowledge and information to them directly from us, as well as that hands on training to just step through anything that their installers may have questions on. I find that kind of face-to-face discussion and hands on training to be very important. Secondly, it provides them with that certification that can be included, again, in their submittal packages. This can assure GCs, building owners, downstream customers that additional training, additional measures have taken place concerning the window system. Not just them buying a window and slapping it into a unit. We’ve actually stepped through a process of training and auditing to make sure that that overall system is good.

Finally, probably what I consider at least to be the most important this certification is a form of continuous improvement. It allows the modular factories to continue to provide an excellent product to their customers, which at the end of the day, is what this is all about. It's making sure that as a total supply chain, we are providing each of our customers with excellent products so that the end user is completely satisfied. So, from our perspective, this program is a step that we feel we can take and a service we can provide to help improve the piece of the modular construction process from a window manufacturer standpoint we are involved with. So, those are some of the benefits that I see with the modular factories.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, this program is brand new, as you said, it hasn't even been officially rolled out yet. You're going to introduce it at World of Modular starting March 8, but how do you see this program evolving over time? What are your hopes for it?

Chesney Beck

From a program standpoint it’s a little difficult to tell us exactly how it's going to evolve, but I can tell you what I hope happens. What I'm hoping takes place is that growth of communication between us and the modular factories. We'd really like to see this program act as a steppingstone for discussions concerning the best way to approach installation, the best way to approach even window design. That continuous improvement piece goes both ways, right? We're trying to help the modular teams improve the installation piece, answer any questions that they may have. We as a window manufacturer, also have opportunities for improvement. We see this program as being that two-way street of opening the doors for us to be able to listen and hear from the modular factories, here's what you need to know, here's what you could improve on, that would really help us. We want to see that happening. So, we see this as just that true continuous improvement step. That enhanced communication can even get further up or downstream to dealers, and GCs architects, owners, whoever may actually get involved. So, everyone in the supply chain has opportunities to improve whether it's the products, the processes to make that project more successful. So, my hope is that this program will be kind of one of those overall improvements to the system.

John McMullen

Tell me more about how the certification program came to be. Were you looking at trends or data or just focusing on your own experiences?

Chesney Beck

Yeah. This is a good question in that there's a lot of our own experiences that went into this. Several factors that we see within our walls really helped drive towards the need of the certification program. First, there is significant time and money spent, whether it's by the modular factories, by ourselves and others, concerning troubleshooting of window system issues anytime there's an issue in the field. There's a lot of time and effort trying to figure out what truly happened, where's the issue? How can we get it fixed, all of those things. So, anytime that we can prevent those field issues from occurring further back in the system and reducing those field issues, we are reducing a significant amount of waste in the system. So, I would say that at the end of the day, no matter what the true situation is, the amount of effort, time money, materials, all of that to get there is substantial. So, we want to be sure and anything we can do to prevent that and put a preventative measure in place, the better we are.

So first of all would be that reduction of waste. Secondly, we've had a lot of internal requests from our various modular partners and customers to provide product and or installation training. We get that request on a real regular basis. So, we've kind of felt that offering an annual training program built into this certification would be very beneficial simply from the number of requests that we get on a regular basis. As I mentioned earlier, ultimately, we fill that form of continuous improvement throughout the supply chain. It's obvious to us with all the different modular factories that we currently do with that. Everybody absolutely wants to provide an excellent product to their customer, and this is simply our way of trying to try to help completely nail down the window piece of the overall puzzle. So that's why it came to be; those were the things that really played heavily into our decision to roll this out.

John McMullen

So, switching gears here for a second and we touched on this before a couple of times, I know that WinTech is exhibiting at this year's World of Modular. The format's a little different this year with everything being online, but besides this big rollout that you have planned, what should attendees look forward to when they visit your booth?

Chesney Beck

Yeah, sure. Thankfully, the World of Modular team has provided some really great and key tools to assist in making the online event as close to an in-person event as possible. So, at least from WinTech's perspective, we're very thankful for that. We see this as being a great opportunity to have a good, virtual net. So, some great tools there. We plan on uploading several videos, ranging from introduction videos, say with key WinTech team members, to product related videos, installation related videos, all the different products that we that work well in that modular world and application. We're going to have a lot of videos at our virtual booth and then visitors to our virtual booth can also expect access to downloadable documents, such as product brochures and installation instructions, details concerning this certification program that we've been discussing several other items that that are going to be there. So frankly, it'll be very similar to if this was an in-person event. All the stuff that you would expect to have at the tradeshow we plan on having at our virtual booth. Adam Verstraete, which is our modular divisional manager, and I are also delivering a breakout session presentation that discusses general window issues, as well as the certification program. So, we are going to have that breakout session as well. In general, we're absolutely looking forward to the upcoming show. We're very excited about it.

John McMullen

Excellent. For those who are unable to attend the conference, hopefully those are very few and far between, but for those who aren't attending, is there a way for them to get in touch with you about the certification program?

Chesney Beck

Yeah, absolutely. So, there's a there's a couple of different ways. The first way would be to go to our website. So, our website is www.wintechinc.com. And at the website, if you go to the Contact Us piece, there is a modular section there where you can email directly to us any questions that you have. Frankly, that's probably the best way to get in touch with us. We check that website piece very often. If you go to our website, hit on the modular piece, you can send us an email requesting anything all of our contact information is on there as well. Whether it be the divisional manager, phone numbers and email so anything that you need www.wintechinc.com we will get you there pretty quickly.

John McMullen

Well thank you so much for your time today, Chesney. I really appreciate you coming on. It sounds like this certification program has a lot of potential. I just wanted to wish you luck.

Chesney Beck

Thank you so much again, John, I appreciate you having us it's been a pleasure.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.The Evolution and Future of Modular Showers w/ Roman Ltd.

John McMullen

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.
Hello, and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. I'm talking with David Osborne, CEO of UK-based Roman Showers. David is here to talk about the evolution of modular showers and current trends within the industry.

David, thanks for calling in.

David Osborne

Thanks for having me. Nice to be here.

John McMullen

So, tell me about yourself David. How did you end up as CEO at Roman?

David Osborne

Well, my father actually started the business in 1985. So, I joined straight from university in 1992. So, I was thrust straight into it. It's been a bit of a marvelous 29 years now. So, we’re very excited. The business has transformed and we're in a very good place now.

John McMullen

Well, that's good. That's great to hear. For those who aren't familiar, tell me more about Roman Showers itself. Where exactly are you guys based and how did the company get started?

David Osborne

Well, we were based up in County Durham in northeast England. So, we're really not that far from Scotland. Originally, the business started from scratch and if you think back to the 80s, the original idea was actually different color printing onto glass. Then it was matching with the different bathroom colors at the time that we seem to have moved on from that, but they were all the different greens and browns and whatever. So that's where we started from. Now we're three factories up in the northeast. So, we're a 400,000 square feet site. We manufacture shower enclosures, solid surface, moldings, sinks and basins. Then really, we have a solid service fabrication plant, which is doing vanity tops, etc. We have a subsidiary business over in Ireland in Dublin, which is a sales and marketing operation. Then very important, we have a base over in Malaysia, which manufactures over there for the Asia Pacific market, we don't bring anything outside Asia Summit, that's quite a unique thing. Now within all of our products and commodities are coming from Southeast Asia, we're actually manufacturing there for, the Asian Pacific market.

We've got two very important architectural showrooms. One is in London, and one is in Kuala Lumper, which are really both some key architectural hubs. Now we're very much the UK’s and Europe's largest manufacturer, and we supply around the world. We have a joint venture aluminum business in Malaysia as well. But we're very capability led, and especially within really what's cool to you is simply this is the specification hospitality sector and that's really where international business goes. I think the easy summary is capability travels.

John McMullen

That’s quite a bit of growth. That's really outstanding. As we touched on, Roman has been around for close to 40 years now. What have you noticed about the modular shower industry over that span of time? How has the industry evolved?

David Osborne 

Well, I think when we first had initial dealings with the modular industry it was very much more perceived as a simple level entry offer. In the last 15, particularly the last 10 years, the profile of modular building has just soared. Some of the most prestigious residential jobs, all the top international hotels, are now comfortably using modular construction. It takes some variables out, it makes it very international, and we deal with modular companies now all over Europe. Dubai, Middle East, Malaysia, China. Of course, the end destinations can be anywhere. So really, we're seeing a very large growth in the whole modular industry.

John McMullen

So, tell me more about the way you've seen design professionals, architects and other designers change how they've utilized modular showers and other prefab elements.

David Osborne

I suppose in our experience, as modular has become more mainstream, as designers, architects are more relaxed, and understanding what to build we're seeing much more synergy, I suppose now between the desired outcome for the bathroom and the structural constraints and what it will build. So, it's really more integrated now. I think moreover, designers actually now embrace and understand the full benefits of the simplifications that modular building gives them and not only importantly, understand the ongoing service and maintenance benefits and requirements, etc. So, I think that's changed dramatically.

John McMullen

So, you mentioned synergy. How is that synergy and the evolution that we're talking about affected the way that these products are designed and produced?

David Osborne

Well, I suppose in our case, we are a little different in what we do. I mean, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we were simply being asked for a glass shower, showering, area, enclosure, whatever. Now, we've spread to become really producing integrated sharing areas, with vanity tops, bathroom furniture integrated. So, we're significantly speeding up and controlling the installation process as a result. I think very importantly, we're eliminating many of the onsite variables and pre plumbing first fixes can be built in, etc. The huge impact is in integration. We're working with Korey and a lot of other solid surface brands and just building the bathroom structure rather than just a showering area. That’s probably the biggest change.

John McMullen

How do your designers and engineers work? What's the process for creating a new model of a modular shower?

David Osborne

Well, our design team, are used to working in every way imaginable really, with a huge array of different clients and no two are really the same. Sometimes we send visual concepts for the bathroom, and we literally have to break it down into sections and then redesign it really for manufacturer and installation, really break it down itself into modular pieces. Sometimes we receive drawings for really specific requirements onsite. Other times, I suppose we might require the layout to be redesigned, to see what the what the ultimate design goal is. Working as opposed to make sure we keep all the different stakeholders. So, the designers’ clients, the modular partners involved at every stage of that. I don't have the time now. So, the architects or clients are actually asking us to recommend the modular manufacturer, as a sector might be new to them. This is where the development of strong partnerships comes in. We aren't just on the specification, but we're also bringing in and recommending excellent modular manufacturers as partners.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, speaking of manufacturers, if I'm a manufacturer looking to include modular showers in my next project, at what point in the process should I be contacting you? What options do I have?

David Osborne

Well, without questions, ideally at the very start. I mean our products and a variety of installation systems are actually a bit more complicated than they might seem. So, we can talk about installation fixing methods, we'd rather the layout be designed right the first time, obviously. In reality, we don't get involved that many times at the initial stage. Most commonly, a lot of the design work is already done and we're suggesting finishes, some specialist insulation sealing systems. Of course, sometimes we're parachuted near the end of the program, due to someone else's failure, rejection by the client, whatever it might be. But the great thing for us by being a fully integrated manufacturer and designer is, that we might be faced with quite a complicated, specialized bespoke sharing system, integrated top space in sink furniture, and that needs to be installed pretty much anywhere in the world in two weeks. And nobody can do that. That's really what sets us apart in terms of capability. A huge choice of solid surface finishes. Now as you've probably gathered from basic solid colors into marble effects, even translucent materials and things, really, it's a huge design choice.

John McMullen

I read on your website that your products are currently in 52 different countries, which is pretty amazing. What differences have you noticed in the various international markets in which you operate?

David Osborne

I think our website needs a big update actually it’s 63 at the moment. I think with some close relationships, and we work very closely with the main international hotel groups. So, the number is growing all the time in terms of where we've been spreading and developing into new markets. I suppose the most fundamental difference we find is a lot of the developing markets have the sharing area which is stills of left on a on a glass contract a specification rather than being bathrooms specification. So that one that always needs to be changed and evolved relatively quickly. Essentially, we're the only party that moves in the bathroom once it's installed if you think about it. We also then have to act as a giant fish tank. So, some clients can be very particular and precious about the sink. But you know, once that’s screwed into the wall that never moves. So, a lot of the time our key products don't get the design airtime they actually deserve in reality. I think once modular partners get to understand the benefits you get from working with it as an international specialist branded product, it becomes a very different story in terms of how you manage that dynamic.

John McMullen

So, what specifically have you noticed about the design trends over the past few years? You mentioned earlier, back in the 80s, it was greens and browns. I think we're all thankful we've left those behind largely, but how have the trends changed in the past few years and how have those trends impacted you?

David Osborne

I think we’re all glad we left those colors behind. I think the major trend is to move away from chrome fittings and clear glass. In the project market, we offer fifteen specialist color finishes for aluminum and brass. Our manufacturing capability really allows us to offer pretty much any specialist finishes beyond these as long as there's a volume to justify it. We've seen things like matte black, bush nickel, matte white really emerging strongly. That’s a metal trend.

Glass has consistently gotten thicker, heavier, which is very much perception driven rather than performance, but you can't change that. Then we've also seen some industrial look, blacks and crittall style finishes coming in and a really big change is now this retro style of fluted glass coming back into a fashion now and integrative anti tops. Really, that's more of an overall design integration trend where integrative anti tops with showers are the biggest evolution for us as a business in hospitality. It's not just for design, it actually eliminates a real problem, which is the gap between the basin and the shower door that you can't see or clean. The studies are made on proper problem for hotels around the world. It also simplifies installation. I mean, you literally can't fit it wrong. It has to go together in a particular way. We see furniture, shelving, drawers all coming and being integrated as well.

One thing we've developed, which is a big factor for modular industry and people having to then give warranties, etc. In the last five years we've developed a silicon free wall fixing system. So, frames and colors become minimal, in fact, a premium, you don't want to install a covering the framing two inches of silicon. So, when we have a type system that's actually between the glass and the profile and the profile and the wall, so it acts as a as a seal from the inside. So, there's nothing visible, completely watertight, but it's maintenance free and that's obviously a big benefit to everyone in the supply chain.

John McMullen

Absolutely. Are there any other different design trends for showers in different parts of the world or are they all fairly similar?

David Osborne

No. I think due to the nature of the international hotel groups, there is a lot of similarity, but I mean, certainly we pick out a few things. I mean, Asia Pacific was always the one driving wet room design and the double AXA showring and that's really become a global trend now. Not just to design but also the aging population, arthritis, etc. an integration of antitoxin, showers, I mean everyone sort of seems to think they will have the same problems with installers it's everywhere. So, what you can control through modular build and the way we do things is really giving that that sort of guarantee. Middle East is always keen on full height, ceiling fixings for like showers and integrating toilet cubicles next to the showers, etc. I'm sure the US has got some different metal finishes to Europe as well, but these are all very easily solvable. Those ones are in a pretty small place now in terms of design.

John McMullen

Can you make any guesses about the next five years? Are there any emerging trends that you're just picking up on?

David Osborne

Well, I think there is one, whether it's some trend, or it's certainly the reaction to the whole COVID thing we've had, but in Europe the vast majority of our competitors are of Chinese oriented or using Chinese origin product. With this supply chain, disruption pops over dependency on Chinese manufacturing. We're seeing that changing quite quickly and, I think we're doing a carbon zero program at the moment here as a cost level business. And sustainability is only getting home. Everyone's agenda and particularly the main international hotel groups are really focused on that now.

So, we have some as a business here at Roman, we have some amazingly high environmental stats and stories and really embracing the circular economy. That’s really the key thing for the future. We think there are key principles in our process, and it's becoming more and more of a differential rather than just being a valid thing to do. This is washing down from hotels and hospitality into major residential, ultimately, of course, retail, but consumers are more and more environmentally aware. I suppose we must make sure we use a significant environmental impact vantage, counter every stage really whether sector that's in.

John McMullen

So, I'll bring us up bring us full circle you started the show telling us about the growth of Roman Showers. What's next? Where are you guys going from here?

David Osborne

Very bluntly: To the USA, if you want a genuine answer. We’ve been doubling for a few years in the USA and Canada, and we want to do it properly. We aim to be working very hard with all the major hotel groups, we are, but really into the USA and design, manufacturing, environmental strengths really come to the fore in that. So, we are going to be building some significant long-term partnerships in the next few years. That's entirely based having looked at what's going on, it's entirely based on hospitality sector. That's our international differential.

So, its capability around hotel hospitality modular design. So, say we're dealing with groups. We've been over to your conference a few years ago in Tucson. We'll be you'll see us at quite a few hotel exhibitions, and we already know quite a lot of people. So yeah, bluntly. That's pretty much our stated aim in the next five years.

John McMullen

Well, very good. I wish you luck. Thank you, David, for your time today. I really appreciate it. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. My name is John McMullen, I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI, and today I'm joined by Landon Boucher and Sean Lothrop of Innovative Structural Engineering. They're here today to talk about the ins and outs of structural engineering for modular buildings. Landon and Sean, how are you doing today?

Great, great. How are you today?

I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. So, in a nutshell, let's kick this thing off. In a nutshell, what is structural engineering?

Yeah, thanks, John. This is Landon, so I mean really, in a nutshell, structural engineering is a little bit of an art and a science, probably more science than it is art, but it's a portion of the design that involves what are typically the unseen elements of the building, the structural shell or what is sometimes referred to as the bones of a building. And I say that it's a little bit of an art because there's solutions that we can come up with, right? But that we know as a, just from our own perspective as structural engineers, but we're working on a project with a whole team of people, and there's different needs and understandings that each person on that team brings to the table. And so sometimes the art is involved with the creativity and coming up with a solution that fits everybody.

Hey, John, this is Sean. To add to that a little bit too, on a more technical side, we're actually designing the building to meet two specific types of loading, so basically gravity loading, making sure the building isn't gonna fall down due to gravity, and looking at that. And then we're also looking to provide a lateral system design, so if your building is hit with large wind loads or large amounts of seismic load, the building isn't gonna fail in that manner and stay standing. So yeah, that's kind of a summary.

Gotcha, thank you. Landon, you mentioned that there's a team at work here, so what is the structural engineer's role in the project? Where do you fit in?

That's a great question. You know, and so I'm gonna have Sean expand on this a little bit, but you know, we get asked that question, you know, from time to time, and I always phrase it, and really it comes down to three parts, really. Number one, it's to listen. That's how it starts off where we want to listen, understand the customer's objectives for that project. Number two, we want to present the options right on how to achieve those objectives. And then number three, we want to coordinate effectively to ensure the desired outcome for whatever project it is that we're working on at that moment. But, you know, specifically when it comes to sort of the nuts and bolts, if you will, for what our role is, I think I'd like Sean to expand on that a little bit.

Yeah, no, thank you. So we're basically creating, if it's a wood structure, we're creating a wood framing plan to show how to build the structure. You know, at the foundation level, we're creating a foundation plan that shows how thick the concrete should be, where the rebar should be located, where the anchor embed should be. So we're basically creating a plan set and then a calculation set to go along with it to submit to the jurisdictions that allow the, it gives a guideline for the builder to know how to put the structure together to be able to resist certain types of loading. So yeah, that's kind of the summary.

Thanks, Sean. I got another question for you. What process do you use when you're working on a modular project? Is it any different than you would normally use? Do you use specific software, specific strategies when you design for modular?

So, realistically, the process of designing a modular building is very similar to a traditional site-built structure. As far as the structural engineer's view into the project, the way we approach it is very similar to the traditional. Maybe what some people don't understand is that there's a factory component and then there's a site component to this type of building. You may have, we may have a different architect on a portion of the building, but for the most part, there's usually one factory, one architect, and we're working with those two groups to get everything done. But our number one customer is the person that we've contracted with on a project. And so it really varies from project to project, but the two key people that we're going to be interacting with the most in general is going to be the architect and the factory. We're still going to be interfacing with all the other sub-consultants and the even the site construction teams, all of that. But the two main are going to be the architect and the factory.

That's correct. I think there's also a modular specific software that we do use a little bit. I think the listeners would be interested in learning about. Landon, you want to touch on that a little bit?

Sure. Yeah, Sean. So there's a few software programs that we use that are a little more modular specific. There's one called Revit. And that's a program where it's a building information modeling program, right? So what that allows us to do is to create a 3D model of the project, right? And then we can tag each element and we can pull from that model certain schedules and information. So we can see how many windows are in a project. We can see what the square footage of the flooring is. We can pull out all of those quantities. Now, we don't necessarily design in that, but it's more like a checking tool or a management tool. So we have the structural drawings, but we can go back and check them within the model, make sure that we're all coordinated and everything fits and that our structural members aren't clashing with the mechanical members or the electrical members or whatever it might be.

Thank you for sharing that. That's really interesting. So when you're designing for modular, are there any unique challenges or considerations that you have to take into account compared to traditional construction?

Yeah, this is Sean. I think probably the biggest one that comes to mind for me is transportation. We're having to make sure that this building is gonna be able to be transported on the road. So you have a lot more factors that come into play when you're looking at the, especially the foundation and the sizes of the modules themselves. So you need to make sure that you're able to have a crane large enough to set these modules. You need to make sure that the trucking route, I guess, allows for the wide loads and tall loads. And so that's a big thing that comes to play that isn't necessarily a huge deal with traditional construction. So yeah, that's one thing that comes to mind for me.

Yeah, that's absolutely true. And I would just add that the transportation aspect and just the module's length and width and height being limited by what can be transported on the road, that can have some implications for the structural design as well. So you have to be mindful of those constraints when you're designing the structural system for the building.

Absolutely. And what about in terms of seismic or wind loads, are there any unique considerations when it comes to modular construction for those kinds of loads?

Yeah, John, I think there's a couple of things that are unique when it comes to that. So from a seismic perspective, there's kind of two different categories that we look at when it comes to seismic. You have your seismic design for the module in the factory, and then you have your seismic design for the module when it's actually on site and connected to the foundation, right? So there's a lot of dynamic stuff that happens when you have an actual building, right? It's gonna have vibrations from the wind, from the occupants, from the equipment. There's gonna be a lot of different vibration sources in a building. And so when you're looking at the seismic design in the factory, you can kind of try to design around those to make sure that your building's gonna be able to stand up to the wind and the seismic as much as you can. But then when you're on site, there's a lot of stuff that you just can't predict. So it's important to make sure that the foundation is designed for seismic loading, and it's also important to make sure that the anchorage from the module to the foundation is designed for seismic loading as well.

And John, one more thing on that too is that typically, especially on the West Coast, in California, we have a lot of different seismic zones. And so what may work in one part of California might not work in another part of California. And so you really have to kind of look at the specific jurisdiction and what the site-specific requirements are and the seismic zones and really kind of design to that specific site.

That's a great point. Modular construction is often touted as being faster and more efficient than traditional construction. How does this affect the structural engineering process and what kind of benefits does it bring?

So, John, I'll start with that one. You know, from a structural engineering perspective, I think one of the benefits that we're seeing with modular construction is that, you know, the buildings are designed to be efficient in the factory, right? And so there's a lot of efficiencies that can be achieved in the factory that you might not necessarily have on a traditional construction site. So, you know, when you're building a modular building, you can have your tables set up to build the building, right? So, you know, you can have your framing crew or your drywall crew working at the same time in the same building. You're not dealing with weather. You know, we have a lot of weather delays here in the Pacific Northwest with rain and wind and everything else. And so that can slow down a project, but it's not something that you're going to be dealing with in the factory. So I think there's a lot of efficiencies that can be gained just from the building process itself. But there's also efficiencies in the sense of, you know, from a structural perspective, you know, when you're building a traditional building, you might have 20 or 30 different wall types and 20 or 30 different floor types, right? And so every time you change from one type to another, you have to have a whole new design. And so there's a lot of engineering and a lot of drafting that goes into that. Whereas with a modular building, you're going to have the same types of walls and floors and roofs, you know, a repetitive nature. And so you can kind of streamline your design process a little bit. And you're also working with the same crew in the factory for the most part. So, you know, you have the same people that are building the first module, they're going to be building the last module. And so they kind of get a feel for the building and how it goes together. And so you're able to gain efficiencies that way as well.

Yeah, that's a really great point. And I think, you know, the fact that modular construction is done in a factory setting, it allows for more precision and quality control, which is also a benefit for structural engineering because, you know, you can ensure that the connections are done correctly, that the materials are all up to code, that the welding or any other structural components are done with precision. And so it really helps from a structural standpoint to have that controlled environment in a factory.

Yeah, and another thing too is that, you know, when you're building in the factory, you can have, you know, full-scale mock-ups and you can really kind of figure out how this thing is going to be put together before you're actually building it. So you can look at the full-size mock-up, kind of figure out how the process is going to go. And, you know, with traditional construction, you're really kind of building it as you're going and you don't necessarily have that ability to do that. So there's a lot more planning that goes into the factory construction, and I think that's another reason why it's more efficient.

Yeah, absolutely. And speaking of efficiency, does modular construction have any potential environmental benefits or sustainable advantages compared to traditional construction methods?

Yeah, I think there are some potential environmental benefits to modular construction. One of them is that because it's done in a factory setting, there can be more control over material waste. You can optimize the use of materials more efficiently, and you can also potentially recycle materials within the factory setting. Additionally, because it's done in a controlled environment, there's less exposure to the elements, which can result in less material damage and less waste. And finally, because modular construction often involves the use of prefabricated components, there can be opportunities to use more sustainable materials or incorporate energy-efficient design features into those components.

And I'll add to that as well. You know, when you're building in a factory, you're really focused on the assembly process and the manufacturing process. And so, you know, a lot of times, you're using the exact quantities that you need. You're not overordering materials and then having excess material that's not being used, which can happen in traditional construction. And, you know, there's also the opportunity to recycle and reuse materials within the factory. So, you know, if you have some, you know, leftover material from one module, you can potentially use that in another module. And so there's less waste generated overall.

Great points. It's good to see that there are some potential environmental benefits to modular construction. Now, looking ahead, how do you see the future of modular construction and structural engineering evolving? Are there any emerging trends or technologies that you're particularly excited about?

I can take that one. I think one of the emerging trends that's really exciting in modular construction is the use of automation and robotics. We're starting to see more and more automation being integrated into the manufacturing process in modular construction factories. And this can lead to increased efficiency and precision in the construction process. For example, we're seeing robotic systems being used for tasks like welding and material handling, which can help improve the quality and speed of construction. So I think that's a really exciting trend to watch. Additionally, with the advancements in digital technology, we're seeing more sophisticated design and modeling tools being used in modular construction, which can help streamline the engineering and construction process even further.

Yeah, I agree with that, Sean. And, you know, I think we're also seeing a trend towards more sustainability in modular construction. You know, as we mentioned earlier, there are some inherent benefits to sustainability in terms of waste reduction and efficient material use. But I think there's also a growing interest in using modular construction as a means to create more energy-efficient buildings and incorporate renewable energy sources. So I think that's something that we'll see more of in the future.

Absolutely. It's exciting to see how technology and sustainability are playing a role in the future of modular construction. Well, thank you both for sharing your insights and expertise on this topic. It's been really fascinating to learn about modular construction and its impact on structural engineering. Thank you.

You're welcome, John. It was a pleasure speaking with you today.

Yeah, thank you, John. It was great talking with you.

Thank you so much, Sean and Landon. I appreciate your time and expertise, and I'm sure our listeners will find this conversation very informative. Have a great day.

You too, John. Take care.

You too. Goodbye.

Goodbye.Making the Case for Modular System Integration w/ The Cornerstone Collective [podcast

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Suzie Hall, Founder and President of the Cornerstone Collective. Suzie is here today to talk about her experience in the modular construction industry, and the importance of communication in the modular design process.

Suzie, it's great to talk with you.

Suzie Hall

Thank you, John, you as well.

John McMullen

So, tell me about yourself Suzie, what's your background and how did you come to found the Cornerstone Collective?

Suzie Hall

I grew up in the Seattle area. I'm a graduate of the University of Puget Sound and after graduation, I went into the commercial design sector. I founded Cornerstone Design in 1992 and over the years, really became a fan of the integrated design process, getting very involved with LEED and sustainable projects in the mid-2000s. And being a lifelong entrepreneur, at the beginning of this year, I launched a second entity called the Cornerstone Collective, which is a fully vertically integrated design and construction solution that accelerates and simplifies the hospitality, multifamily and healthcare development process.

John McMullen

Very good. So, you the Cornerstone Collective then offers a wide variety of services and that includes modular and offsite services. Is that right?

Suzie Hall 

Yes, we provide consulting, design, procurement, sustainability, lead and integration services across those markets that I mentioned with a special focus and heavy emphasis on modular and offsite. One of our bailiwicks says that we really focus on the micro details that are so important toward the end of a project, as well as understanding the macro view.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, one of the things that stuck out to me during our initial conversations was a term that you used modular system integration. Can you explain that to me? What is modular system integration?

Suzie Hall

Yep. So according to the dictionary, a system is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. Well, in the modular and offsite industry, that takes place in my experience within silos. So master planning, architecture, engineering, interiors, modular factory, site built, procurement, landscape. All of those are silos, so to speak, that are a system within themselves. What we mean by modular system integration is encompassing all of those silos, encouraging cross communication, collaboration, and teamwork. And since we speak those languages across the board to some level, we see ourselves as the glue or, or the quarterback, if you will of the team.

John McMullen

Can you give me an example of what you mean by using one of your recent projects?

Suzie Hall

Sure. Our recent hospitality project, we were in the design development phase toward the end of it, and the first floor had a site-built portion and then guestrooms on the first floor.  Well, when the architect was leading a meeting, and we were all looking at renderings, etc. the ceiling heights didn't match up. There hadn't been any communication about what the prototype ceiling height was in the guestroom and how that connected to the site-built portion. And so, they were being designed, if you will, in silos where the modular factory was taking the lead on the prototype modules as they should have been. But there was that missing link of Oh, how did these two pieces come together? And hey, we've got a discrepancy of about seven inches, which then it was kind of coiling the design back to an earlier layer, so that those two could join up and move forward.

John McMullen

So, what's your experience in the modular sector over the past several years? What are some of the key lessons you've learned?

Suzie Hall

First, to ask a lot of questions, to understand the starting point and the end point. Also, to ensure that all stakeholders are on the calls and in the meetings and not to expect that they'll necessarily read the meeting minutes. I think we're all guilty of that a little bit, right? But if there's that one important meeting that the electrical engineer or the structural engineer isn't a part of, and then the whole thing keeps rolling. In my experience, there's usually come a point where it's a cog in the wheel. I also believe that nobody has all the answers, and to really buy into that integrated design process. And then when it comes to the construction portion, having the modular factory and the site GC be very, very connected and not to assume anything.

John McMullen

I think I think those are all great points. One of the one of the things I heard you say, and I'm really glad you brought up this point about connection, upfront communication, and making sure the scope of the project is understood. It brings to mind other conversations I've had recently, and I know many others in the industry are having them as well, about the misconceptions of modular but particularly when it comes to the price of modular projects. What's your take on that?

Suzie Hall

Yeah, so I think there's a lot of missing clarity in the industry. I agree, I think there's a misnomer out there that the general public might think that oh, "modular's less expensive" and I don't exactly know why they think that. The solution, because of the quality and the speed to market and everything like that, yes hotels, and housing opens a lot sooner; hospitals can be built a lot faster, which then results in greater revenue generation earlier. So, when you think of lifecycle costs, yes, it's very straightforward case, in my opinion, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the building products are less expensive, or the labor is less expensive. Obviously, the labor market and where projects are being built, will indicate a clear path forward for offsite and modular solutions. But when we help educate our clients and developers about the price of modular, we have a pretty robust conversation around all of those key points, and that it's not side by side, oh, pick the modular one, because the price tag is lower off the shelf.

John McMullen

There's so many other things to consider with modular. You've got your materials and your labor. But then I think a lot of people fail to consider the cost of actually getting it from the factory to the site, craning it on to the site actually making the building a building. So, it's just something I like to bring up with people and have conversations about because it's a big misconception, and I think it’s on us as part of the industry to sort of help educate people about that aspect of projects. Are there any other myths and misconceptions of modular construction that you find yourself dealing with regularly?

Suzie Hall

Yes. In the US, I think there is a misconception that modular means not attractive, on the interiors, sometimes on the exterior. That's something that I believe, is because of the genesis of the industry in the United States, versus the genesis of modular say, in Europe, where a lot of it spawned from furniture companies, and the furniture and furnishings industry. So, their product has just historically been more integrated and more focused on the finer details. Now their product when side by side against the US product, in my opinion, you can tell the difference, but it doesn't have to be that way.

So, I think a misconception is that Oh, just because we're thinking about modular means we're going to have to take a step down on the aesthetic. And it's similar to when LEED first came on the market, and we were early adopters of LEED, our collective we have designed and administered over 100 LEED projects over the years. Same thing, everyone thought that for a lead or a sustainable project, it had to look recycled. So, we set out on a mission to really show that No, just because it's sustainable, and high recycled content, rapidly renewable, formaldehyde free, no off gassing, et cetera. It can still look amazing, and it doesn't have to cost anymore. So, there's those big misconceptions out in the marketplace that still exist around modular.

John McMullen

Can you tell me about some of the other notable modular projects you've worked on recently, maybe with an emphasis of showing that modular design can be just as attractive, just as intricate as traditional construction?

Suzie Hall

Yes, we actually have two affordable housing, multifamily projects in California that we are in both on design and development on and the interior renderings we've produced when we share them with the larger team. Everyone said, oh my gosh, those look amazing, but they must be expensive. And it was kind of a wakeup call for me because we knew they weren't any more expensive than pulling a design off the shelf because we knew the products and materials that went into it. So, part of that education process is just because it's affordable, or even housing for the homeless, it can still look decent. We still want to deliver that quality, a decent quality, and it doesn't have to cost any more.

Then in a hotel project that went on hold, due to COVID and it's just coming back online, is the integration of the FF and E and the OS and E package with the prototype, and the finishes all coming together in really great harmony, and how you a little bit of fun with color and having some standout features, even though it's a prototype. There are some public space areas that we have been able to set apart from the rest.

John McMullen

Well, that's cool. Those sound like great projects, I'd love to, you help make some noise about a case study. If you wanted to put one together, send it to us, we can put it on the website. We love doing that kind of thing for our members.

Suzie Hall

Thank you, I appreciate the invitation and I'll be speaking on a panel at the Advancing Prefabrication conference in Dallas, and we might have a case study ready at that time as well.

John McMullen 

Very good. So, what's the rest of the year look like for you? Are you already booked through the rest of the year, you started planning 2022?

Suzie Hall

Yes, we started planning through 2024 being involved in these large affordable housing projects, wanting to use the modular solution. A big part of our approach is that we have relationships with many factories across North America and we want to help increase capacity so that we can provide a template for delivering affordable housing solutions and homeless housing solutions to multiple cities across the United States. As we all know, that's a huge problem in our country.

So, we have geared up and our raising capital toward that and partnering with nonprofits, having conversations with factories about their products so that we can engage as many modular factories and team members as possible. So just in the last few weeks, it seems like someone has turned the faucet on. I don't know if you're feeling that, but all of a sudden, it's very, very busy out there both on the multifamily and the hospitality side.

John McMullen

Well, that's fantastic. I love all the work with affordable housing. There's huge potential for the industry, I think. So, anything we can do to help you out there, please do let us know.

Suzie Hall

Wonderful. Yes, we'd love to.

John McMullen

Thank you so much for your time today Suzie. I really appreciate it. I appreciate your perspective on the communication, and I loved hearing about the projects you guys are working on.

Suzie Hall 

Yeah, thank you and just you know, as a parting thought, just having a game plan. My background, my dad was a major college football coach. So, I've always had that kind of perspective. It's a team and someone's got to be leading the team. And having that game plan is so important on all of these projects.

John McMullen

I agree. Absolutely. Thank you so much.

Suzie Hall

Thank you, John. It's been enjoyable. I appreciate it.

John McMullen

Sure. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Constructing an Award-Winning Mixed-Use Firehouse Inside a National Reserve w/ Modular Genius

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Damon Pross, President of Modular Genius. Damon is here today to talk about the challenges and successes in constructing a modular firehouse. Damon, thanks for coming in.

Damon Pross

Good morning, John. Thanks so much for having me. It's a pleasure.

John McMullen

I really appreciate your time. Let's dive right in. It's my understanding that Modular Genius is celebrating 15 years in business this coming May, is that right?

Damon Pross

That's true. Just coming up on 15 years in May. It’s just been exciting and fun.

John McMullen

Well, that's fantastic. Congratulations on that. You're, of course the President of Modular Genius and as one of the co-owners, founding co owners, I should say, tell me about how Modular Genius got started.

Damon Pross

We think it's a great story, myself and my two business partners, also founding co-owners, started in the industry almost 25 years ago each and started out as a small business, which is now probably if not the biggest modular supplier in the industry.

We worked there for years, learned a lot from the grassroots up and midway through work and I'd say 10 years into it, we started seeing different opportunities and niches for kind of this medium, middle of the road market. And hence, just started having conversations and created Modular Genius. We started off just doing some of the simple relocatable work and some simple projects just to get the company established to grow things and get cash under our belt. Then 15 years later have just grown this thing into a relocatable, permanent modular company that does turnkey solutions, design build and all sorts of contracts throughout the United States.

John McMullen

That's awesome. As you mentioned, you and your business partners have had a long career in the modular industry and even before Modular Genius got started. What can you tell me about yourself Damon, about Modular Genius, and maybe even a little bit about the industry as you've seen it grow over these years?

Damon Pross

It's been a fantastic ride. I guess really to start with myself. Again, I started about 25 years ago at a timeframe when I would say the industry was developed, but still growing; still kind of in its infancy stage. So, I was fortunate enough to kind of learn about everything throughout the industry, not just technical installation, construction, but just the whole business aspects. As I developed and grew, I was fortunate enough again, just to really be part of an industry that is now where it is today. A little bit about Modular Genius as I mentioned, when we started out, we felt that we saw this middle market that some companies are doing real small projects, some companies are doing some really large projects. We started doing some small and develop into the middle of the road projects I'll say and have since grown doing some of the big stuff turnkey.

Again, we're 15 years at it now with Modular Genius. We continue to grow, continue to increase our resources and technical support. So that really ties back into the industry. The greatest thing I think I'm very fortunate myself, Brad Gudeman, Dave Vanicky, they're all the co-owners, again, just with tons of experience, but we've seen just as an industry really develop and grow over the past 25 years. But I'd say even more so in the past 10 years. We’re doing some major offs with you know, we're calling in modular, but it's off-site construction. We're getting the site ready, while we're also getting the building ready.

Hence, we can offer speed, less disturbance on site, a lot of green building portions to it, less waste, and some really major initiatives that clients, existing clients and prospective clients for Modular Genius, as well as the industry are just really taken advantage of that. I think in a nutshell, it's just the industry itself. And just really develop and come up with some really excellent building solutions for all different types of building uses and types of clients and business sectors. It’s just been fantastic and exciting.

John McMullen

It has been. I know that the industry has just been booming. I was taking a look at Modular Genius’ website in preparation for this podcast and it seems as though you guys have done a little bit of everything with permanent and relocatable projects really in every sector. So, I was curious how has Modular Genius’ processes evolved over the past 15 years, as you've been working on all these types of projects?

Damon Pross

Again, the process we started out walking before we ran. And with that, I mean, we did some work in this industry. There's a lot of temporary classrooms and relocatable swing space and for government entities, and we started doing a lot of that work, which didn't take a lot of capital, cash and build up. Then we started doing some medium size works and turnkey services. Hence, we've evolved into a full turnkey firm. We always tell everybody we can do your project in whole or part, complete turnkey, our sweet spot.

We are a modular building contractor, but we also have GC license in over 35 states. So, the neat thing about Modular Genius and what we've done to develop and grow, it starts with our people. We have obviously the executive management group ownership, we mentioned about our experience and expertise, but more importantly, we just have a team that can support the design, project management and installation. Individuals here that are employees that have infrastructure, site work experience, as well as modular and the whole process throughout construction.

John McMullen

I want to turn my attention to the firehouse project I mentioned in the introduction, because it's a very cool project. It's a Pemberton Township, Modular Firehouse and Community Center, which, besides being a great project, is notable because it won first place at our Awards of Distinction in 2020.

I'm curious, what are some of the challenges you faced during that project?

Damon Pross

I'd say that the most interesting one out of the gate is that the project was located on a National Reserve. I actually didn't know anything about it. The mayor of Pemberton reached out to us and his business team, and they needed to replace an existing old, dilapidated fire station and replace it on a National Reserve. The Pinelands National Reserve is this 1.1-million-acre piece of land that in the 70s the government, it's I believe one of the first if not the first, National Reserve. It’s a community just made up of what they call the Pinelands Barons. It’s apparently 50-some communities there's like, developments but within there, there's farms, forest and protected species of animals and plants. So, as you can imagine, putting something there we had to be careful with the land, we had to be careful with the look of the building and the community and whatnot.

So, I'd say that was that was one of the most interesting and greatest challenges and then the other piece was working with them in an expeditious way to help them for lack of a better word. It wasn't a formal full design bill but help them design this from taking that demoing an old building and replacing it and giving it a new look and feel doing it through design procurement and contracts, which we ended up. They ended up using utilizing, which is a cooperative purchasing contract that we're a contractor on called the Keystone Purchasing Network. So, I'd say those two are probably the primary when it comes to getting the job going and making the job happen. Then you also have your construction sounds, but I think those were the most interesting.

John McMullen

Well, it sounds like there was definitely some delicate site work that had to had to go on there for that project. Tell me more about the conversations you had with the township itself when the project was being considered. What ultimately got them to decide on a modular structure?

Damon Pross

Again, we were replacing an existing building that sat there that was I don't know the exact age, but I believe it was before the 70s. I mean, it was inhabitable. So, it was a fun project, because we got up there and we came up just in I'd say in the pre planning stage and said, here we are, here's this building. Again, we got to meet which they have a comprehensive management plan in the Pinelands you have to find, you know, follow ecological environment stuff. So, we saw this building and we said we have to demo it. Then we have to replace it. That’s when the rubber hit the road, the wheels started turning. We had to think about environment, ecological, we had to think about obviously demo and health safety. Then the fun part for our team and their team and a whole collaboration, even with the Pinelands management plan that's in place that you have to follow was just creating this beautiful static building that's modular.

Again, this project has been on their radar for a long time, so they wanted speed and minimal disturbance, which modular offers. Again, they tied in that KPN contract, which is a procurement contract, and they were able to kind of put all the pieces together, I'd say, the whole group. Modular Genius, Pemberton, townships’ mayor and his team as well, as you know, the architects and engineers and everyone we pulled together.

John McMullen 

Nice. You’ve mentioned the KPN, the Keystone Purchasing Network, a couple of times. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

Damon Pross

Yeah, one thing we always like to make clear is, there's several purchasing co-ops throughout the nation. Our experience and understanding is this is one of the stronger ones and it's a purchasing program where this organization will go out, and it started a lot in the education market, but it's hence moved to local government and entities are though, but the long and short of it is they put together a program, and they go out and bid formally bid in multiple states under state contract procurement laws, and they bid products and services to create this co-op for better purchasing power bigger purchasing power. For example, Keystone Purchase Network has hundreds of schools throughout the United States buy an off of it, like literally even trash bags, so you can imagine that if they can say two three cents for trash bags throughout the year. It's just a huge advantage.

Plus, they eliminate the procurement process because they've already done it. So, the neat thing too is they supply like again, we're a contractor on there. We bid this formally for the modular boarding building piece classrooms and buildings, they have office buildings dorms, we formally bid it and we're awarded, but they do amazing stuff. They're like furniture, roofing supplies, even like athletic fields, trucks, pretty much name a product and a school would need or even a private entity or local government municipality. It's a lot of the stuff on there.

John McMullen

Definite advantages there for sure.

Damon Pross

Yeah, it's competitively bid in each state, and it just minimizes the procurement process. It gives better buying power. We went and bidded, they'll actually put down specific business use buildings; they have modules on there, they have specifications, they have the installation work, so you can purchase a building off of it, lease a building off of it. We can do the installation and that's what we did with timber. For this fire station, it actually started a relationship started where they were growing their Department of Public Works and Pemberton went and did the keys that they signed up. It's interesting to become a member, there's no fee, and there's no surcharges, because that's already been considered. So, they do volume discounts in the products and services. So, Pemberton township signed up as a member on this contract, and not only modular my understanding is use it for other products and services.

John McMullen 

Very cool. I'm going switch gears on you for a second. I was reading about this project, I think you mentioned this before, that the fire station was inspired by and built with the local National Reserve in mind, can you elaborate on that? What was what was done to help the building really fit into its environment?

Damon Pross

A lot of things. The neat thing about this project, to tell you about a firehouse, is this project the township wanted to have the fire station and community center to help revitalization and to bring the safety and health portion of the community together. So, it has public meeting rooms as well as the fire station, there's different sectors. So, the neat thing about the building is it's traditional, modular with an upgrade modular. We married the two types of modular together again to give them speed and minimum disturbance on site. But to answer your question, the part about the National Reserve is we had to work with the Pinelands. They have a management plan and come up with very nice statics to blend in with the community but more importantly, with the National Reserve.

So, if anyone that's listening wants to kind of see more about what we're talking, we have this on our website, and we also have it on our social media platform on YouTube. It'll show you the installation of it and then the final finish project. So, there's case studies, you can visit modulargenius.com you can visit YouTube. What you'll find is this building, it's amazing when you look at it because you'll see this happen. Half high brick finishes that kind of blends in to give you that forest outdoors look with a green hardy panel and a Standing Seam Metal Roof. When we got the colors, we were kind of like wow, this is kind of interesting, but when it came together, it was just beautiful. When you say it sits on the reserve, it sits in the community, and it just blends in. I would say, again, the collaboration just put together a really nice-looking building that ideally meets the use for the community, but then also just has a really, beautiful look to it.

John McMullen

It is a nice building for sure. I was wondering if you could tell me more about the factory-built portion of the project, how were you able to include the Apparatus Bay, those big open spaces for the fire trucks, and connect those with the firehouse and the community center?

Damon Pross

Well, any project that starts and you mentioned for those that are listening, when you do a firehouse, you have the Apparatus Bay, which is the fire equipment and where they supply everything that traditional roll up doors that you see on the fire department. That application itself is like a slab on grade and you just drive obviously just like any garage, you drive the truck into the garage, and then that's where we utilized modular building. That's one of our key suppliers with lean manufacturing has a patented system. It's a modular system that dates a hinged wall system that we use so we can get to higher heights to be able to you know 18–20-foot height so you can get a fire truck in there.

So, it's manufactured in the plant while we're getting the site ready. Again, it's a hinged system that we build in the factory the roof and the walls and when we get the site, we crane it we pull it up and the hinged walls pop out, we lag them to the foundation. Then, we just start doing the finishes and finish the site work. The other piece to it was what we'll call traditional modular, that's the occupied space for the fire department staff office, restrooms, meeting rooms type stuff, area for them to hang out while they're waiting for calls or working on things. Then they had a community center and that also had its own space with restrooms and a little kitchen for the community to utilize. That portion was also built in the plant, both were being manufactured at the same time, both sides Apparatus Bay, and the traditional modular occupancy side to at the same time, we were getting the site ready. When I say we're getting the site ready, we're doing the excavation, we're putting the foundation in place, and then we're bringing in the utilities. Hence, that's where we can do the project. That's where the modular industry, Modular Genius, anything offers the speed, we did this project for them. They'll test in about half the time that it would have taken it would have taken them a year and a half, two years to complete this project. And we did it from the design procurement contracting stage in less than a year. So, it turned out really nice.

John McMullen

In general, are there particular structural considerations when designing fire houses and really any other building that requires a lot of open interior space? How is that accomplished in a factory setting?

Damon Pross

The most important thing, I think, for the modular industry to express to people is it’s no different than quote unquote, traditional construction. So the way it's completed in the factory, or even just the overall project is exactly the same way it has to be designed, engineered, inspected, stamped and sealed, where you have a professional engineer stamp all the drawings architecturally mechanical, electrical plumbing, we do that in the manufacturing plant, majority of states, if not all have a formal process, that they have third party engineers and have a process that they put together that looks at the drawings and make sure they meet everything for the state. Structurally, mechanically, electrical, plumbing, ADA, everything. So that entire process is exactly same construction in general. Then, what we do, you mentioned about just having clear span or wide-open area, that's what you call clear span in any construction. It's literally the same materials and steel that you would use the span. It's structurally calculated, designed, and incorporated into the building.

So literally the same process, same inspection, same engineering reviews, code requirements, compliance, National Fire Protection, that's the beauty of Modular Genius. In this industry we do that as part of the process to get to the finish line. So, during the design planning stage, we figure all that out. We put it together, it's formally executed. And then on the back end, you know, when you're completed, you have everything in compliance.

John McMullen

I appreciate you going into some detail about that. know that can be sort of a misconception about modular construction, that everything needs to be a little module, a little room, little rooms connected together. But really, modular construction is more than capable of doing these big open spaces that really can be used for anything. So, I appreciate you going into that a little bit. Tell me more about some of the other notable projects Modular Genius has worked on last year and coming into this year.

Damon Pross

Well, you made me think right away when you said that about the misconception. We are one of the top multi story modular contractors in the nation. So, we have a neat project that was underway, three storeys that's modular without con. Its business use. It's one of our most notable ones, but I'm kind of trying to tell you in two parts that misconception. This is a multi-storey building, three storeys modular again, same design codes engineering, we're going to provide them finishing up speed, less disturbance on site, which is going to be a better return on investment quicker return on investment for them, and still give them that that business use office space look feel. We do permanent applications. These buildings have the same life expectancy of any building that's out there.

Some notables that we had; the neat thing with Pemberton is we're going to do a police station addition for them. We've just had just such a good relationship and success with the team and using that Keystone Purchasing Network contract. Anyone that’s interested in that if you visit our website at modulargenius.com and you scroll down to about us, purchasing cooperatives, and then KPN, you'll see all other contracts on there. You can gain more information about that, and it spells it out. I always tell everybody, again, we're contractor KPN can vet and tell everyone how to utilize it and what to use and how to sign up. And that links on there too. So, you can get a hold of their director. But we have information on there to help people understand. But it's really fun, because we're doing libraries. We like to express this is what Modular Genius is doing. But the industry, this modular industry and this kind of takes us back to the beginning of the growth and development and how the industry has evolved. We're doing multi story projects, we're doing single story projects, we're doing permanent relocatable projects, but they include the high schools temporary and permanent, education use, business use, libraries, government entities, churches, fire departments, police stations. So some of the, the projects, that are out there to name a few. We're doing Baltimore County Schools, Baltimore City Schools, Montgomery County schools, all schools throughout the Mid-Atlantic region, just different government entities and municipalities. It's just amazing. The amount of work that's out there, but this solution that modular offers, and this is what we've been doing in 2020 and what we see in 2021.

John McMullen

It's definitely been a fantastic time for the industry. I know a lot of people I've talked to are just as busy as they want to be. So, the industry is just taking off, which is great. Great for all of us. What's the rest of this year looking like for you guys at Modular Genius? Are you planned through the year into next year? How far ahead have you got projects?

Damon Pross

The year started out great. The first quarter is at or even over budgeted. Second quarter, we've been picking up the amount of jobs that we thought we'd have and we continue to see in our pipelines full through 2022. Again, those projects include some of the stuff that's on the on the radar, or there's several government renovation projects going on where we do relocatable space, we call it swing space. So, when they renovate, we'll put a building out 3000 10,000 20,000, or multiple buildings to house staff temporarily while government buildings are being renovated. Federal, local municipality, whatever. So, we'll do that we'll lease it for 12 months, five years, depending on how long the project is. So, there's a bunch of that work that's in front of us at Modular Genius and I would say industry wide. There's a ton of continued one of the biggest markets is education. And I would say primary education, colleges, universities. Everyone in that industry is always looking to change and move space, whether it's temporary permanent additions, they always like the opportunity of leasing, or if they get permanent, they like the idea of doing an addition and again, having the least disturbance, being able to do it quicker. A lot of the schools don't know their enrollment or things are changing and they need to get something done in six to nine months versus 12 to 18. So, they take advantage of the modular. So, we have a lot of that education work, a lot of healthcare work.

One of the notable projects we've done is a hospital addition. We do like emergency room additions, we do all different hospital additions. So, we have multiple health care, different types of labs. There's a lot of COVID work going on, whether it's social distancing, and organizations, whether they're business and education needing more space. But then there's also new initiatives with you know, research and development and health care that many of these organizations are taking advantage of modular. Again, I'll say it over and over again, speed, minimal disturbance, most hospitals you go to, how easy is it to find parking or define land? Right.  So, when you do a modular project, you can build it in the plant while you get the site ready. And you have you know; you don't have all the laid down material and you don't have all this stuff sitting taking up parking lot space or land for 6-12 months.

A lot of hospitals take advantage of that modular piece because of that, but it's been fun again, assembly used business education, just so many different sectors, so many different clients. It's just an amazing solution that I think, you know, if anybody listening wants to learn more, they can. Our website is really robust in the sense that it'll tell you about Modular Genius, but it will tell you about the industry. You can learn about the industry, the advantages of modular, off-site construction; you'll see case studies, you'll see just services, you can go and get a quote on our site, you can get a floor plan. So, anyone listening out there, if you're interested in modular or Modular Genius, visit our site. It'll take you to great opportunities just to learn how beneficial modular is and how it can help projects. Again, return on investment, speed, relocate ability, if you need it, if you need to lease something, if you want to purchase something, permanent building additions, it's anything that you need built can pretty much be done.

John McMullen

Well, I really appreciate your time today, Damon, and I know Modular Genius is busy as it can be. I appreciate your time and stopping by today and having this conversation.

Damon Pross

We want to thank MBI. Thank you so much. We were proud to be awarded this because we know how much time and effort in the committee they put together. We just want to thank MBI for all that they do as well putting this podcast together but more importantly, how much they do across the globe for modular for the industry. And I'll just the members, all the different contractors, it's just a great organization. So, thank you so much.

John McMullen

Well sure, on behalf of us here, you're very welcome. It's a pleasure for us and it's great to have members like Modular Genius. We appreciate it. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Examining the Global Modular Construction Market w/ DORCE Ltd. 

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Mehmet Yucesoy, Business Development Manager at DORCE. Mehmet is here to talk about the challenges and opportunities of the commercial modular market in Europe and the Middle East. Mehmet, thanks so much for your time today.

Mehmet Yucesoy

Thank you very much John. Thank you very much for your time and attention of this process for us.

John McMullen

So, for those who aren't familiar, tell me more about DORCE itself. Where are you based and how did the company get started?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, we're a company more than 40 years old and I will try to explain very briefly what is the stage at the moment for DORCE. I mean our company DORCE is one of the first established and the leading company based in Turkey, on prefabricated modular steel structure manufacturing, exporting and also including the contracting services. So, at the moment, we can provide full turnkey services for prefabricated modular structures for more than 60 countries including the production, logistics, assembly, infrastructure and superstructure works, testing and commissioning. Also, we’re able to provide all the international quality standards. We build prefabricated modular steel and conventional structures with the support of our engineering and contracting capabilities.

John McMullen

So, you mentioned that DORCE has been around for 40 years, that's very impressive. How has your company evolved in that time?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, I think the legacy first of DORCE started track back to 1980s, I mean, in 1982, the company started with small virtual operations based in the capital of Turkey in Ankara, with the production of minor steel construction works steel furniture’s. The company quickly evolved to become a key supplier of prefabricated steel structures as Turkey's biggest construction and manufacturing company on the light gauge steel structures in the first 15 years. With that, we have two different capabilities and the locomotive sectors. The first one is the as the industrial manufacturer company and the second one is the contracting identity. So, with the combination of these two capabilities after approximately the 2000s, we became one of the biggest contractors in the world especially for the engineering procurement construction projects. After 2000s our company manufacturing facility is reached to a production facility which is approximate to 100,000 square meter total area with 60,000 square meter closed workshop area.

John McMullen

It’s an amazing bit of growth, very impressive. I've read that DORCE’s manufacturing production capacity is one of the largest in Europe. Can you tell me more about your capacity and the capabilities that you have now?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Sure, with the coming years DORCE evolved a lot in the oil and gas mining power plant and the petrochemical industries, especially in CIS region and Middle East. Then we reached out per month capacity as the biggest manufacturer of Europe on light gauge steel structures, approximately 160,000 square meter panelized prefabricated buildings or 4000 units of containers manufacturing capacity per month, or 2000 tons of pre-engineered heavy steel structure capacity. So, which is the right now the largest capacity, calculated base of Europe as a company based in Turkey.

John McMullen

That's a huge amount of production. What challenges have you guys faced as such a large company?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, almost all of the projects of DORCE have been special. We can easily say that. I mentioned about the 4000-container manufacturing capacity per month. So, our projects are always very urgent, and you have to complete your projects on time, with the highest quality and the best reasonable prices. So that gives the success of DORCE but also gives us some challenges because we are working in defense industry. We completed approximately 100,000 people capacity military camps in Afghanistan in Iraq, also aircraft and helicopter hangers in Djibouti, Somali and different parts of Africa. So, all these projects have specific designs, and you have to comply with all the local regulations, all the quality standards, and especially for the oil and gas companies. We work with ExxonMobil, ENI, Shell, PETRONAS. From Malaysia to Middle East, to South America, we complete our projects everywhere. So, we're able to work from minus 50 degree to plus 50-degree areas, which means that you have to comply with all the quality regulations in the limited time in different geographies. And, you have to train the local workforce with a specific design team and R&D team. You have to overcome all these challenges in different countries. Apart from that, there is another aspect, this is an organization job not only a manufacturing, or not only construction, it's also a combination of engineering capabilities because we complete different projects in different fields. So, these are the main challenges that we face, but we always overcome these obstacles. And also, we go to success with these lines, together with ours with the support of engineering capabilities.

John McMullen

Well, again, it's just very impressive. I guess I was not surprised to read that engineering news record, ENR, has listed your company as one of the top 250 contractors globally, which is very impressive. Congratulations. What can you tell me about your contracting capabilities?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, thank you very much John. We’re listed as one of the top 250 contractors for the past decade. DORCE is the leading manufacturer of Europe, on this light gauge steel structure manufacturing. But apart from that we are also listed in the contract in the top 215. The main background of this rating is that we are also a pure contracting company. We have right now actually, I can give you an example for that, we have two ongoing projects in Iraq there. Those are pure concrete projects. The one is 400 plus four to six VIP bed capacity 15 story concrete I mean general conventional method of construction, a university training hospital, which is the largest building of the Basque region of Iraq, and which has a helicopter pit on top of it.

Apart from that, we have another ongoing project, which is almost finished right now. A 1400 housing project in Buster region of Iraq. And apart from that, these projects are fully completed full turnkey with DORCE’s manpower, DORCE equipment with the local registered companies. And we complete many a conventional system MSP buildings in different parts of the world. But these are the pure contracting capabilities. Apart from that our contracting ratings are generally the revenues come from the major oil and gas projects. So, which means that we have an ongoing project in Mozambique right now for 10,000 people labor accommodation facility, or we finished a 100,000 people capacity refugee camp facilities in Middle East and Turkey also. So, in order to complete this project on turnkey projects on turnkey basis, the manufacturing is not only you know if you need to finish a call the city's infrastructure. So, these are the main contracting capabilities where the contracting ratings come from for DORCE.

John McMullen

Wow, you guys are busy. So, you guys are all over the world doing all these different projects. I want to turn our attention to modular construction here for a second. In general, what can you tell me about the market for commercial modular construction in the Middle East and Africa? Is it an emerging market is modular, widely used there? What can you tell me?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, it totally depends on those sectors in the country. Also, some of the countries in the Middle East and in the region...They have to finish up the projects very quickly. So, as you know that’s the main reason it’s accomplished. For example, in Gabon, we have finished 600 housing projects within a six-month period, because the government wants something very quickly and they want to give the housing units and the modular housing structures to people immediately. So, it took, let's say, a six-month period to complete 600 housing units or in Oman, in the Middle East, there was an industrial area. The people in Middle East Asia...they have to finish the hotel project within 150 days. So DORCE was the solution provider for that for a three-star hotel project full turnkey with a modular construction prefabricated system. So, we manufactured the unit ready and transported to the site location immediately, and the project finished in 160 days. So, it's totally time and the money. These are the two most important aspects. Then coming to your question, the Middle East and Africa, they are the emerging markets. And the modular systems already started the US for the past 10 years...especially for the housing units for oil and gas for the mining the number of the projects increasing day by day.

As you know that in Saudi Arabia, there is a huge project called the Neon City Project. So, they are going to use the prefabricated modular systems for the mining and for oil and gas, especially in Qatar, in the United Arab Emirates, you have to finish the project immediately. Those have the regulations are much better than the general conventional systems. For example, in United Arab Emirates, we have finished the 26,000 people capacity and Labor Rate residential city project for the superstructure within a one-year time period. So, the time was very important, because the area was rented for the investors for 30 years, and they gave a timeline for the completion of the project for one year. So, in a commercial system, you can finish the project within three and a half years, but when you finish with the modular construction system; you gain three unhealthy years, and you rent the labors three, two and a half years, and you make much more money. So, depending Yeah, I mean, it's not only for the commercial, it's not only for the housing, it's not only for the different sector, but a lot of projects are also coming up in Middle East in Africa. And these are the developments, some parts of the countries that development, some parts like UAE, Qatar, they already got to go up to some point. So, all the modular containers, temporary emergency facilities for refugees, immigrants, for Syria, I mean,...the modular construction is everywhere in these parts of this world. It's very important and developing very quickly.

John McMullen

So, you touched on a lot of the benefits of modular construction all over the world. How would you say, in your experience, how does the market for modular construction in the Middle East and Africa compare to the North American market?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Modular construction is actively being used in North Africa, in Canada in the United States. Let’s say, especially in California, when we look at the earthquake areas, the steel structure and the modular systems to compare the left. Also right now, in Turkey, let's say since our company based in Turkey, I want to give an example for one of our ongoing projects. After the earthquake the city called Malatya, we have been almost counterpoints. With the completion of 1,500 units of housing projects as the government program with the prefabricated modular systems. These are the villages in the top of the mountains in the middle of the city everywhere, very quickly finished projects. Also, comparing rates of the North American market in the Middle East and Africa, fire resistance and earthquakes are very important, which means that especially for the commercial modular systems for the housing units and the shopping malls, the numbers are increasing. We came out with a modular system and, of course, I think there are 506,000 units, detached houses in California.

Of course, it's not very popular like that, but it's very important, especially for the big cities like Doha and Istanbul because the modular system and prefabricated system is much shorter construction time, safety and security is much higher; climate conditions are much better. Also, it's very ecofriendly and the traffic, when it comes to very high population cities, traffic is a very important issue for the construction. So, you've finished the project immediately. So, these are very important points and compared to North America, the numbers are increasing, especially over the past 10 years.

John McMullen

So, what market trends have you noticed over the past few years? Where do you see the global industry headed?

Mehmet Yucesoy

This is a very good question because right now, the modular building systems are changing with the support of the technology. We have a motto for DORCE, what we say, DORCE is Turkey’s global brand in modular buildings where the construction evolves with the technology; so, we industrialize the general conventional system. This is where we're going to be happy not for the global industry. Let's say fire resistance is a must for the oil, gas and mining industry at the moment, for up to three years. So, this is the only way that you can go with the steel and lower carbon footprints. Also, the steel is the ultimate green material, especially for the recycling, you can use whenever you want and up to two or three different recycling methods, you can use this model for 100 years; those are very safe, the production is under control. It's very important for funding companies, let's say if you're a funding company, you need to check all the details.

So, you can check on the manufacturing facility and complete the project without any obstacle. Modular is more used for the portable and demand table and rebuildable structures, which means that you can move the structures from one point to another. The model system is very important for the emergency response after the disasters. I think in the following 10 years, almost in every country, the modular construction, I mean, the MMC model, the metros of construction are going to be applied, and the companies in the United States or companies in Turkey or in the Middle East, they're going to be growing up a lot with the support of this technology.

John McMullen

I think you're absolutely right. And speaking of some of the other countries where you operate elsewhere, if you give me some current projects in Africa, or the Middle East or the CIS countries where you operate, can you give me an example specifically of one of the R&D related design solutions that you put in place?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Sure, R&D is applied in error in our any project that the DOJ executes because we have a very developed team that we have seventy- five architects at the moment; engineers, technicians, drafters and we work as a team for each project specific specifically. What I'm saying is that we have an ongoing project as mentioned in Mozambique right now for the Mozambique LNG. We designed the project step by step, the manufacturing totally accordingly with the manufacturing items, and without any problem project execution process is going on. But I have another example right now, we just finished a project in Qatar, I think which might be the largest capacity for the COVID currently in hospitals. We have finished the project in Qatar, for 4,000 people currently in hospitals, and coming up to an R&D facility that I think also we have ongoing housing projects at the moment in Africa and CIS region. But for the R&D it’s related to design solutions. I can come up with a very interesting example because we have 40 years with the use of the new generation materials and construction technologies for the sustainable innovation.

As an example, we just finished helicopter portable containers, which is the abbreviation of HPC. This is for the modular structures. You have a container empty you can imagine a container which combines the three packages, and each package is approximately 300 kilograms. So, you put the three packages on the top of the teacups, or the helicopters and you put them on the top of the operation fields a mountain or anywhere and wishes and arrange double legs and two soldiers can make the installation without using hand tools. So, at the end, when you finish the module without using enhanced tool by their hands, you can have an accommodation model for eight soldiers, you can have the WC units, or you can have shower units or colonics. So, when we start this for the defense sector after we noticed that we received the requirements, actually from the different sectors from NGOs, from United Nations, they really liked the installation without using any hand tool, and its very light structures. So United Nations already requested from us, for Bangladesh for different parts of the world, these modular units. And these are also requested from drilling companies for oil, gas and for mining. So, when you use the R&D, it was first started to carry out with this course, helicopters, to the operational fields now, we develop these units to different parts for different sectors, and we're sending 1000s of them to different parts of the world.

John McMullen

I love that idea. I'd love to see some pictures if you can share any or a case study or anything like that. I think lots of people would be interested in that kind of a project.

Mehmet Yucesoy

Sure. I will send that to you.

John McMullen

Thank you. What has made DORCE so successful as a global business over these 40 years? What advice would you give to companies that are trying to become more globalized?

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, you mentioned we started 40 years ago, the manufacturing we pushed ourselves to be very successful in the manufacturing. I mean, our factory is a very huge factory. If anyone would like to see, effectively they can come to Turkey and see the factory, no problem. But it's in the center of the industrial hub. So, when we request any method, we don't need to search them in the factory. So, we can just buy, or we can just manage the supply chain from the neighboring factories. So, it's very important to be centralized in the industrial hub. The sector from our manufacturing facilities are coming for that. We were lucky to have the company in Turkey because it's very easy to transport the materials from Turkey to the ports from Mersing, Istanbul or Antalya no problem to Africa, from CIS-to-CIS region or Europe. So, we can transport them everywhere in the world. As an example, we finished a project in Australia for the housing units, because the compelling case for Turkey is labor costs, the material costs and the currency changes.

The housing unit was very expensive to finish in Australia. So, we finished the manufactured the units and transported to Australia, or we completed hospital projects in Venezuela. So, we manufactured them, and it was very cheap to send them with our prices to the other companies in the area. To complete the project in Chile hospital projects were very cheap. So, the location was another advantage and experienced workforce, and the training of the workforce. These are very important. And most importantly for the global companies to become more globalized, you need to check all the details of the localization and the local regulations of the country that you are going to make export, contract export and contracting activities. So, we always go to the country that we are going to export we complete full feasibility studies. We spend time over there, we meet with the local and government authorities, we study the regulations, we always work with the professional law companies over there. And, we checked with the full details for the cultural dynamics.

You need to be fully ready for these aspects. And you need to finish strong market research. You need to know all the details for the custom and the tax details. And most importantly, we created very successful joint ventures and partnerships with the local companies. Then you train the local workforce when you work with the local companies. You always finish your project on time. You always deliver your projects on time and with the success over completion certificates. When you're if you're very successful also on the HSE and quality regulations, I mean there are many different points to be successful in the global market, but these are the main points which comes to come to my mind at the moment. So, these are very important and with a shipment of these points, then you can be very successful company on the global market.

John McMullen

Thank you that was that was great. So, Mehmet, tell me about DORCE. For North America, are you guys looking to expand over here? Do you have relationships with companies over here? Tell me about that.

Mehmet Yucesoy

John, thank you for this question. We’re have very actively been working with the companies from North America for more than 25, actually for 30 years. I mean, in Mauritania, we finish their project with the Kinross, gold from Canada, for gold mining company for 10,000 people. Labor camp, we also have been actively taking part for the projects of nature for 20 years, and we have been working with KBR and US Army for NATO in different parts. We finished a lot of projects for floor, and we finished a lot of projects for the United States government, especially in Algeria, we finished the embassy structures. Also, for United Nations, we finished a lot of projects in Ghana, we finished projects with Bethel for 600 housing projects. We are very much familiar with the support of these references with the support of these revenue estimates and other United States standards. Therefore, for the past couple years, United States, Canada and North Africa is an interesting market for DORCE company.

So, we're planning to register a company, we are very much open to creating new partnerships with the companies from the United States, from Canada in different fields, especially in the construction. We would like to share our know how, and we would like to learn more about the standards from them. So, we are very much open for the North Africa and North American market. And, we are interested to meet with funds from North America to work with them for our projects, interesting projects in the third world countries. Since we are very active in the other countries, we have been receiving hundreds of projects, very specific and very nice projects, especially for the housing units, for the mining for oil and gas for the modular construction.

So, it will be also very interesting for DORCE to meet with the funding companies, and we’re open to create new opportunities and open to work or to partnerships with DORCE. So, this will be great for us.

John McMullen

Well, that's great to hear. We were talking before about World of Modular and we're planning to be back in Texas next year. So, I hope to see you there.

Mehmet Yucesoy

Sure. We previously participated in the exhibition and the booth over there. It was an amazing event. I met with a lot of people over there from the modular construction industry. I mean, I will be very glad to participate to event once again, I come to Texas, to see you to meet with you and to see other participants.

John McMullen

What's next for DORCE? What can you tell me about your upcoming projects.

Mehmet Yucesoy

Our sector, I think, for my personal it is the best sector because right now there's the COVID-19 situation going on, unfortunately, it’s affecting everybody and all the governments. All the oil and gas major projects, the major EPC projects, all of this stuff. So, we noticed that there is an emerging market at the moment folded and in we supplied 25 different countries, the superstructure of the COVID-19 hospitals: intensive care units, mobile hospitals, and clinics. Before COVID in the conflict areas, we were able to complete military camps because it was an urgent need to finish the military camps to protect the NATO and NATO related countries. Apart from that there is migration, so this sector is always booming. This is what I'm trying to explain for the question because I think after this, the economy will probably get much better.

So right now, we're building a lot of refugee camps. After this process, we don't need to build military camps, refugee camps or COVID-19 hospitals that most major oil, gas and mining projects going to this third thing, and the government's going to be revising up their economic health budgets with the macroeconomic dynamics; which means that the government's going to start their housing programs, there are 1000s of housing units required right now for Africa, for the United States for Turkey for South America everywhere in the world. I believe that housing projects, school projects and education projects where prefabricated modular systems are going to be blooming and we are going to be taking part for these kinds of projects and we are going to be taking part I believe for major LNG and renewable energy camp projects.

John McMullen

Well, that's just an amazing amount of work. I want to thank you Mehmet for your time today. I know people here in North America tend to think of modular construction, as you know, relocatable buildings at construction sites and housing and that type of thing, but you've given some great examples of how modular construction can be used, really in any different type of industry. I really appreciate your time today. It was great to get your global perspective. I really appreciate it.

Mehmet Yucesoy

Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.How Owner/Developers Can Best Get Started with Modular Construction w/ R & S Tavares Associates

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Pedro Tavares and Anthony Gude of R & S Tavares Associates. Anthony and Pedro are here to talk about how owners and developers that are new to modular construction can more easily integrate it into their project plans. Anthony and Pedro, thanks for calling in.

Pedro Tavares

Yeah, thanks for having us.

John McMullen

So, Pedro, let's dive right in. I'll start with you. Can you give me a little bit of background on your firm and tell us about yourself and your background in the industry?

Pedro Tavares

Yeah, sure. Our firm was started by my parents were Ralph and Silvana Tavares. My father's an engineer, my mother's an architect, and they moved our family from Rio de Janeiro to the New York City area, in 1987. Basically, my father was sent there to investigate real estate at the time for an employer he was working for in Rio. What he found when he came out here in 1987 was that the US was in the middle of a recession. There wasn't much going on, but he saw modular construction projects going up. He started asking some questions. He got into some job sites, made a few suggestions, and he was offered a job. So, he's been working in the modular industry since that time in 87. He and my mother went on to become a plant engineer and architect at Westchester Modular Homes around that time and worked there for several years.

My father then went on to continue working at different modular manufacturers across the country, moving my whole family from initially Connecticut to upstate New York, down to Orlando, Florida to Kansas City. We made it out to California in 1999, where he was working for a manufacturer in the Central Valley. In about 2002, he decided to start his own consulting business with my mother and that's when our nest of ours was formed. He took on a lot of the modular clientele he'd developed over the years. In 2007, we opened the office in San Diego to attract more talent. We had a hard time finding any in the Central Valley, and that's where we've been permanently stationed since my father. He currently carries a PE license in 43 states and is the chairman of the design committee of MBI. He's also a trustee of the Educational Foundation, a five-year former board member, and he served on and off the board. In 2013, he received an outstanding achievement award for contributions toward the modular industry. A number of our projects have won awards of distinction that direct recipients or affiliates, and my father contributed to the guidelines for the safe use of ISO shipping containers. And he's currently working on authoring the 2024 IBC chapters related to modular construction with that task force.

John McMullen

That's an amazing history. I didn't know Ralph started back in 1987 so that was very cool to hear. That's a great story. Thank you. Anthony, how about yourself, what’s your background?

Anthony Gude

Well, I have an engineering background. I went to school in Hoboken, New Jersey, also from the New York area I suppose. I later got my MBA and started working in the New York investment team, primarily with asset managers and national general contractors. I discovered modular and really never looked back. So, I've been tracking the various team for some time and joined when I realized they had opened an office shortly thereafter.

John McMullen

Very good. So, Pedro, back to you. R & S has a long history. As a firm and as an individual, that's had considerable experience in the industry, how do you help those who are new to modular? Traditional owner developers, for example, how do you help them wrap their heads around the concept of modular construction? Why should they make that leap?

Pedro Tavares

So, for anyone that's stepping into modular for the first time we can take them by making an introduction to a vast network of manufacturers that we work with. What we think is important is when you’re starting a project off in modular that you have that sort of team set from very early on, including potentially identifying manufacturer, because I think there's a lot of benefits in having a manufacturer on board when you are working within their preferences, and that particular manufacturer idiosyncrasies, for instance. In that case, you get to also take advantage of their materials that they commonly use, they have a tremendous amount of purchasing power for it. So, if you're able to work within the sort of guidelines of that manufacturer, then I think that helps push a project along a little easier on the modular side.

John McMullen

So, for the owners and developers who truly are new to modular, having the team in place is critical, of course, but I was wondering if you could describe for us some of the benefits for that owner developer, to get into modular to bring a modular project in their portfolio, what are the benefits for them?

Pedro Tavares

Well, we're big believers in modular construction. I think the US has a long way to go in sort of getting to the point where we see modular happening across the pond in Europe, Scandinavia, Japan, in those places. But we're big believers in what modular should be and what it can do. And what I think the main benefit of modular construction is, of course, the time savings. We've seen significant schedule shortenings on projects that contribute a large amount to the amount of construction financing needed, the amount of overhead that's needed on site, and a faster time to occupancy helps everyone's performance.

John McMullen

And so, Anthony, I'll turn to you. I've got sort of a follow up question based on what Pedro said, Pedro was talking about getting a team together, which is critical. What about the design process for modular? What are the unique considerations for a designer as part of that team? What should they know before starting out on their first modular project?

Anthony Gude

Okay, well, I can answer that in a number of ways. I guess we could say that the timelines being accelerated and the benefits of modular construction, there is a tradeoff. Teams need to work more cohesively and that ultimately, the way the constraints of fabricators work, get the front load that design process into the project workflow. So ultimately, what many designers should acknowledge early on is that the design process looks very different than that of traditional construction, maybe not in form, but in in structure, and the importance of communication across the team. So, at R & S, we've invested a lot in keeping our teams cohesive and streamline to turn around designs quickly, because ultimately, there's more of a call for speed and accuracy early on in the process. So, I would say that those are the two primary focuses that that should be brought to a designer's attention early on in the project.

John McMullen

Gotcha. Pedro…

Anthony Gude

If I could jump in with a plug real quick. One thing that's unique about us is that we have our staff right now is half architectural designers and half engineers. I think that's unique for a firm of our type catering, the modular construction, we handle, basically, every discipline in house. We’ll author the A, S and P sheets on a project. We're kind of a one stop shop for anyone looking at doing a modular project.

John McMullen

Well, that's fantastic. You actually led me to my next question. We're talking about designers, and you brought up engineers. Pedro, I was wondering if you could speak to something for me. How can modular engineers—with all the variables that they juggle on any given project: materials, volatility, location, the needs of the facility, all these things—how can they best leverage the modular construction process?

Pedro Tavares

I think the best leveraging comes really from getting into the weeds with that manufacturer and seeing what they're comfortable with and what makes them sort of take a step back. If you go in with a lot of complexity that a manufacturer is not used to, you're going to wind up with scheduling problems, delays in the construction and probably a cost increase just because it's kind of strange. When we developed our first project here in San Diego, we got into development a number of years ago. It was funny because we go to manufacturer A, for instance, and say we want a level four drywall finish. And they'd say, well, that's going to be way too expensive, we're not going to be able to do that. Then we'd also tell them this was like a predominantly residential builder, manufacturer A, for instance, that I'm talking about in this case we'd say, we want our bathroom, fully tiled, floors and walls. They say, okay, that's no problem.

Manufacturer B on the other hand, it's more of a commercial modular builder, we'd say, we want that level four drywall finished, they said, no problem to that, but the tile work was a big problem for them. So, it's just kind of these tradeoffs between manufacturers and what they're used to.

John McMullen

So, let's go back to that first time, owner, developer, Anthony. The first-time owner developer, once he or she has a project in mind and has started to work on a plan, when does the full team that Pedro mentioned early on, when does that full team of GCS the manufacturers, when do they come into the picture? What's the best way for that team to communicate and coordinate?

Anthony Gude

Well, the answer to that one is simple as early and as soon as possible. We see a great benefit in those project teams that come together early. Primarily so we can sort out those tradeoffs that Pedro is referring to, for efficiencies that we can gain early in the process. And then as a team comes together, and everyone gets familiar with the needs of this unified group, then determine how you're going to translate and communicate designs and draft and how you're going to approach the project from a scheduling standpoint. So ultimately, the answer is as early as possible, and open up your options to those team members that are best suited for the project. Many want to win the business, of course, but there's a lot of different considerations from geography to finishes, as Pedro was referring to. So that's, best sorted out as early as possible.

John McMullen

And Pedro, again, for the first-time owner developer, what are some of the unique construction considerations involved in modular? What should they expect and how will it differ from their traditional still stick built projects that they've done in the past?

Pedro Tavares

I think you need to be aware that the modules themselves, they're basically limited by shipping constraints, and what we can do on the road, and perhaps at sea, or however these modules are getting to the site. There are width limitations on those and with varying widths come increased costs, because once you pass certain thresholds, there are pilot cars needed and things like that perhaps CHP, or Highway Patrol escorts, they get kind of expensive. There's also a high consideration due to shipping, getting under those overpasses and other areas like that. Once you exceed a certain height, you need to get a specific kind of special permit that also gets expensive. There's the length as well, which is kind of unlimited actually. You'll see those wind turbine blades going down the highway at times. The length isn't really much of a limitation other than it's often limited by the manufacturer's capabilities of what they can fit under their roof. I think that those are the biggest considerations when designing a modular project and exactly where those mate lines meet up, how you're doing your service crossovers with plumbing, electrical and mechanical. Yeah, those are definitely the largest considerations that need to be made on a modular project.

John McMullen

Gotcha. A question for both of you, in all your time at R & S Tavares, can you tell me about some of the lessons you've learned during your time in the industry? Are there specific projects that you can tell us about that were particularly helpful in your understanding of the potential for modular?

Pedro Tavares

One project in particular that I lost a lot of hair on was a replacement hospital in Joplin, Missouri for the hospital that got destroyed by a category five tornado a number of years ago. That project, wound up being the fastest built medical facility of its size, like in the United States. It was a rush to get that done, that area had a need for that facility and so everybody really kind of put the boots on the ground and work that out. We got that thing designed, permitted in probably a record amount of time. And it was up and running soon after, with the involvement of a couple manufacturers, Walden Structures, that's no longer a manufacturer here in California, as well as NRB, I think, worked on modules for that, and we shipped it out to Joplin, and kept that up and running.

John McMullen

So, what was the key to the getting that done so quickly?

Pedro Tavares

It was just a really integrated design team, manufacturer, ourselves and the architect. In that case, we're just in constant communication, and just sending paperwork, sending drawings back and forth, and having a good RFI process and things like that.

John McMullen

Anthony, were you going to say something earlier?

Anthony Gude

Oh, yes, I was going to have Pedro take it first with the project experience. I had a feeling you'd bring that one up. For me, being involved and sort of transitioning to a structural focused firm, for me highlighted the importance of structural value engineering, Really from being one of the primary cruxes, sort of in getting that value from your premier modular project. Before that, I was at DC firms, and there's a lot of coordination and emphasis on planning. But it wasn't until I was here, sort of as a copilot, that I really got to see firsthand how that kind of comes together. And then of course, what is the key to a great project is that integration and that cross communication across the teams. And really, there's a direct link, there's almost less of a, there's a need for that efficiency, for it all to come together. And that's primarily where firms should be investing and progressing. At RST, that's our system. And our process is to work as efficiently, quickly and effectively with clients and partners.

John McMullen

Excellent! I’ve got one more question. What does the rest of 2021 look like for RST? I've been talking to lots of people and their calendars are full. So, what's the year look like for you and beyond that?

Pedro Tavares

Well, just in the last few months, we made a handful of hires growing rather quickly. And yes, like much of the modular design and construction industry we're seeing quite a pickup in demand. So, we're out here meeting that demand trying to make sure we serve our clients incredibly, effectively. And yeah, so it's mostly a hire up to meet demand and streamlining those systems so we can turn around designs quickly and get these projects out the door.

John McMullen

Out of curiosity, have you noticed any trends lately in what you're designing the types of projects that that come in the door or is it a mixed bag?

Anthony Gude

Oh, boy it’s mixed. Pedro, do you want to answer that one?

Pedro Tavares

Yeah, sure. It is mixed, but we're real busy on the ADU side of things right now. The state of California is really pushing the creation of those trying to meet housing demand, thinking that that might be a way to do it. So, we're doing a lot of ADUs. Container projects are still popular and keep becoming more popular so we're doing a lot of container projects. And then just multifamily. It's the same thing. The housing crisis in California, is just pushing multifamily projects. So, a lot of five over one, five over two podium projects, and big apartment projects, things like that. A lot of what we're doing right now.

John McMullen

Nice. I know MBI is involved in a lot of stuff in California and lots of states, but particularly in California, getting those projects off the ground and trying to clear some red tape. So that's great that you guys are staying busy with that.

Thank you guys so much for your time today. I think this was really great information. I think the first-time owner developer hearing this will have a much better understanding of what to expect what he's getting into. So, thanks again. This was great.

Thank you, John. Thank you for having us.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Building During a Labor Shortage: A Modular Case Study w/ Best GEN Modular

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Michael Heitsman, President of Development at Best GEN companies. Michael is here to talk about Best GEN's new BG Flats project and to discuss how the labor shortage is affecting the construction industry. Michael, thanks for your time today.

Michael Heitsman

Thanks John. It’s great to be here.

John McMullen

Tell me about yourself. How did you come to be at Best GEN?

Michael Heitsman

Well, so I took kind of a fun path. I actually started out my career as an architect, graduated from architecture school, got licensed to work for a couple of different companies. One specializing in hospitals and medical fields, and then I transitioned to another company that specialized in senior living. That firm was a little more fully integrated, similar to what I do now, but not quite the extent to what I do now. So going down that route with that company, I worked on a project where I was the head designer for a big senior living facility outside of Kansas City partnership with a hospital there. He designed three projects there, I was designing three projects. One of them was an assisted living three story facility. The second was a four-story skilled nursing facility. And then the third was a fitness center.

So designing all three of those projects, at the same time, we had three different construction types. I was doing the assisted living with modular construction, do that's where I got into the modular world. The skilled nursing was four stories, type two construction, so it had to be two hour rated. We actually use the panelized light gauge, prefab wall assembly for that project. Then the fitness center, was just standard post and beam.

John McMullen

Sounds like quite the juggling act!

Michael Heitsman

Oh, my goodness, yeah, it was quite interesting. We had a really good team, it’s a really good company, the partners there with the hospital and the other fitness company were great. It was just a great team, we communicated well. But doing the assisted living project really threw me into this module world not knowing a single thing about it. I kind of approached the project, kind of like some architects do. A little hard headed thinking I knew what I was getting into. It's quite a humbling experience looking back on it and learning what all I didn't know about modular construction. It's not as simple as lining walls up and making boxes stack on top of each other. So that was an incredible learning experience. There's a lot of things I learned after the fact of what not to do when it comes to modular. So that's really helped my career move forward. When I decided after that project to leave that company, I started my own architecture firm called Pure Design in Kansas City.

I started out with an emphasis on modular construction, and consulting and designing in that world because I really saw that there was a disconnect and a lack of communication between the architect, the owner, and the contractor in the modular factory. No one knew how to communicate what and when with each other to understand how to get the project done, truly successfully. But I saw the incredible abilities that modular had and so I saw there was a future there.

So I just dove in and started my own firm and right away started consulting with the factory that actually built my assisted living project in Kansas City at the time it was called Superior Building System. I started consulting and designing hotels and multifamily projects for people and the company just kind of took off. I ended up meeting Brandon who owns Best GEN companies, the end of 2018. So we started talking over the phone kind of hit it off. Needless to say, when he decided to purchase the factory in 2019, that I've been working with, he asked me to come on board and head up his development side and bring the architecture firm in house, because he believed as I did that, we wanted to create a fully integrated company that could come into a project, do our own development stuff and come in and perform all aspects of a project.

So that's where we started. In 2019, he bought the factory, I came on board, Pier Design, and it's still up and running. When I came on board on the development side, within Bastion, I brought a good friend of mine who took over who's been in the architectural world, as well for a while, Casey Culberson and he took over running the architecture firm. It's just been taking off. He'd helped me previously with the modular so he had experience there and dived in.

I think we're up to six employees now in the design firm. So that's taken off, and we're working on projects, from a design standpoint from I think he's got a project in New Jersey out to several in California and everywhere in between. So that was a great thing. And then on the development side, I'm here in Rapid City, and focusing on our own internal development stuff with Brandon because that's essentially his background for the last 25 years. BG Flats was the first big development deal that we've done holistically as a company and brought the entire group together to get it done.

John McMullen 

Well, that's awesome. It sounds like many exciting things are going on, BG Flats among them. I want to talk to you about that. You guys are setting that project right now, is that right?

Michael Heitsman 

We are. So, within companies, we have our own BG construction, led by Donnie who's built all over the country as well. So he came in-house and was wanting to get our construction company up and going. So BG Flats is our first project and we're actually setting in ourselves. So we're doing all the construction work and it's our first set job. What's been great about the modular industry is, it’s kind of a community where people love to share and help each other out. My first experience with modular was with a company that I think everybody in the module industry knows of ProSet; they set my first project. I got to know Scott and Matt upfront right away and been talking to them and working with them ever since. They've set a few other projects for us that we've designed and built. And they're just great guys.

So they were willing to step in, give us some pointers and help us figure this out. Offered to come and sit on the sidelines and point things out to us if we needed them, but they're always a phone call away. We just felt that we were willing to enable to get in and set our own box. So it's going a little slower. Not as fast as if those guys were doing it, but we're getting it done and we’re getting it figured out.

John McMullen

So what can you tell me about that project specifically?

Michael Heitsman

It’s going to be market-rate apartments here in Rapid City. It’s 51 modular boxes, 42 apartment units consisting of six studio apartments, 16 one bedroom apartments, and 20 two bedroom apartments. It's actually designed based around our own plug and play concept that we developed with us having no architecture in house and with our experience there we really approached this project to create a concept and a design that we could easily just go into any new development and plug and play or adapt the project to fit the need of the performer of the specific site, that kind of thing. So we have a studio, a one bedroom, a two bedroom, a three bedroom, even a four bedroom unit, as well as fitness entry, common area circulation, that all fit within the same parameters and grid. So you can literally pull one piece out and stick another one in you can have a two bedroom that sits over a one bedroom and a studio or vice versa. So we don't have to stack our same unit types above each other. We don't have to do all the typical things you they're really kind of strange you with modular, we're a lot more flexible with it.

We approached it really as a team concept and we got the guys in the factory on board to really think about how the how the factory builds, and how they're doing things to influence the design. Then we got our contractor and our subs on board early on in the design to say, Okay, let's think about this from an end game. What does it look like when it sets? What are we doing in the factory versus what do we do on site? So it's really helped.

John McMullen 

I was reading about the BG Flats project and some of the other projects that you guys have done. The BG Flats is housing, it's more of a suburban setting. And I was going to ask what's the what's the biggest difference between the BG Flats project and maybe some of your previous projects that were not in suburban areas?

Michael Heitsman

I guess it really there's not a huge difference other than we've been really strategic about not settling, just because we've always done it. So our big thing in a company is to always be improving and always be adapting and always be innovate and try things and see if it works. So with this one that we actually took concept of, 'Okay, let's look at this from what all can we do in a factory to really simplify the site?' I mean, we went so far down to look at all the details for the exterior finish for the roofing, the finish roof membrane, for parapets, all that kind of stuff to see. Okay, what else can we do in the factory to save us time on site. So when you get into more of the rule development, it's harder to get subs out there. So if we can do more in the factory than we have no, doing the rural side, and that harder to get to sites is a lot easier.

John McMullen

Gotcha. And speaking of rural settings, this is a bit of a sidebar, I was watching the video on your website that was showing the setting of the Holiday Inn and seven days, which is really great video to watch. But I noticed it was really windy in the in the time lapse video that you created. And so just my own curiosity, how do you account for that wind, when you're setting mods with a crane?

Michael Heitsman

You make sure you have a good group. That project was set by Hayes Modular, which is another very good set crew. It takes a good crane operator, a good team and good communication. So we didn't set that. So that that project we were the architects for and we were the modular factory for but it was a different developer and different GC and texturing owner under developer GC that did it that we've worked with in the past. This is their second modular project. And they're just really getting good at it from their own standpoint of doing the site work and development side of it. Okay, but they brought Hades modular and to set it and I think they did have to take one day off because of it was just way too windy. But otherwise, that they were able to make it, make it go at it.

John McMullen 

Very good. I was just curious. So back to BG flats: Tell me about the history of that project. How did it come about and what was the design process and the construction process like for that project?

Michael Heitsman

The project started, Brandon has been doing real estate development, like I said for 25 plus years. So he's got a couple properties here and several properties here in Rapid both land and eco building. And we started to have a gap in our line there at the factory. So we decided to go ahead and proceed with doing our own apartment complex. To help fill that gap is really originally why we decided to move forward with it. So we kind of pushed the design. But what was great about it because we have design and construction and everything in house, we were able to really talk through it and you get the design done quicker, solve our problems ahead of time, a lot of issues that always come up and then again, because we have design instruction in house when things did come up, we were able to solve them a lot faster. Actually one example that we have as you know, the industry right now is struggling with labor, labor material, everything.

We started out with a design doing a facade on the project, or we cannot find an effective installer to come and do it that wasn't months out or trying to charge us a ton to do it. So we decided, Okay, let's go back to the drawing board. And so we literally sat down because we have everything in house and sketched out on some trace paper, design and utilizing LP siding, and came up with a new contemporary kind of look, that still looks good, feels good and goes after the look, we were going for it. And we were able to do in a couple hours, and we were able to adjust pricing and get us up on board and not lose any time the schedule actually saves schedule time and utilize a product we knew we could get at a price we could fit within our budget.

John McMullen 

So now that the modules are being stacked, is there a timeline for finishing the project?

Michael Heitsman 

Yeah, I think they're hoping to be opened by August, running out by August.

John McMullen 

Okay. Very good. You mentioned some of the challenges that you had during the process of design. Are you anticipating any other challenges to complete the project or does everything look smooth ahead for you?

Michael Heitsman 

Well, I wouldn't say smooth. We're still running into problems and delays every day, even just getting lumber on site to do some of the minimal side components. Even finding work has been a struggle, we've been trying to hire guys for a long time to run the different parts of our construction. So with the amount of work we've done in the factory, and how modular friendly it is, and how site friendly it is, now that it’s set as long as the guys we have hired don’t leave, then I think we'll be okay.

John McMullen

So it’s a good time to segue; I think you're speaking of challenges. And this has sort of been a recurring theme through just this conversation of a shortage of labor. The construction industry as a whole has been challenged by labor shortages over the past several years. So what's your take on that? How has Best GEN been impacted by that directly? Where do you think we go from here?

Michael Heitsman 

Well, I think the one struggle Best GEN has just with where we're located reasonably around the country, is here in the Midwest. You don't have the same construction costs that you do out in California. And so out there, when you're paying $300 a square foot plus to build a hotel you can charge more for the boxes, while a lot of our customers here in Colorado, Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska, they can build a cheaper. So that's one thing that we're up against. And then the labor itself finding the people to come in, as you said, it's been two or three years of this labor shortage. And we see it all the time. With our company we've had to offer, and we've wanted to full benefits, and just go above and beyond with extra incentives to get people on board. We pay a good salary. We have sign on bonuses, we have all these other things we've had to do and incorporate to get people in the door. We've been good about when we finally get talent, keeping them do whatever it takes to keep them.

John McMullen 

Do you feel that the labor shortage has affected you guys? You're based in South Dakota, has the labor shortage affected you guys in your area of the country any differently than other parts of the country that you've noticed?

Michael Heitsman 

I say it's all about the same. For me, I haven't noticed any different than when I talked to other developers and other factories and VCs out there. from Arizona to California, everyone's struggling with it. So I don't think it's better or worse around here. It's just some that everyone has to try to solve and figure out how to get past.

John McMullen

So, this may not be something that we solve here and now, but--in your view, just from your experience in the industry--how can we as an industry address that overall shortage?

Michael Heitsman

Some things that we started doing here the company is is attacking the Problem early on, I go into the high school and talking with kids and try and actually doing things where we can find good talent may actually pay for them to go to the technical school or go to the technical colleges and find them some good talent there and say, Hey, now we'll all pay for your school. If you commit to staying with us for five years, or some after that fact, I think, to solve the issue, companies are going to have to get innovative like that. I think, for me, I was I was pushed growing up that you had to go to college, you had to go get a four year degree. And it's how I don't believe that's the case, I think there's several other avenues to go and be extremely successful without having to go to a four year degree. So if you have a skill or something you're passionate about something you love to do, then then go and do it. Or if there's something you're good at doing, just go do it.

John McMullen

Right. So I think that's great, especially going into schools, I know of several other members of MBI have started similar initiatives at their local colleges, community colleges, high schools, technical schools. So that's, that's great. I'm thrilled to hear you guys are doing that. I think it's the right way to go.

Changing gears one more time, from a development point of view, what advice can you offer newer modular companies, or those who are exploring modular construction?

Michael Heitsman

If you're wanting to get into modular construction, just find a good team to work with. There's, there's some really great contractors out there that know what they're doing. There's some really great architects out there that know what they're doing. And, you know, really investigate that and dig into that. And the architects can design, you know, whether it's site built or modular. And so if you find a good one that you can work with, then you can go kind of either route with that one, that's one thing that we do, that we started doing early on from a design standpoint is we, we take a project and if we went under contract with you for the design, we do a pretty much a module package to assess it to see if it made sense for modular. And if the owner came back and decided after that, then that he didn't want to go monitor, then we would just transition our whole team to do site build, and it wouldn't cost anything else. So or if they want to stay modular, we keep going modular, but I think the issue is, you know, a lot of developers go into it and just design our standard building that's not modular, that then might be able to be built modular, but it's not efficient, modular. And then they'll just get an architect to draw something up. And then they'll go talk to a modular factory and say, Hey, can you build this? Well, most backers out there will be able to figure out how to build it. It just doesn't always make sense. At that point does it makes sense to go modular? If it's done right, with the right team, and thoughts from the beginning, modular can…there's so many advantages to it. I think people also get hung up on Well, I got to do a, you know, Lego block building that everything is identical and stacks on top of each other. And it's just this square rectangle thing. And that's not base.

I mentioned the innovative aspect of what we do. And we've really pushed the limits on that from the design to the factory to the construction, and we've designed some two-story clearstory space. We designed a bank, we design a credit union that has a two story lobby that has one box that opens up to a box on top of it. You can design stuff on that is pretty common for cantilever thing. We patented, I think we have five different patents have on some unique things we've come up with, we can span like 30 to 40 feet within our box to span over pools, so you don't have the additional steel for the site component. And so you can save a lot of money there. But it also gives you the flexibility to have open spaces underneath it without all the columns or open boxes up next to each other without all the columns inside it. So there's a lot of flexibility in it. If you know what you're doing, and you can think through it. So early on, I'd say find an architect, find a GC, find a factory, and just create that partnership and just have good open communication.

John McMullen

Excellent advice. Thank you. What's the rest of the year look like for Best GEN? I know you've got your BG Flats going up now, but beyond that what's on the horizon?

Michael Heitsman

On the horizon, we're actually getting ready to do some townhouses. Then we're transitioning into a senior living project, and probably not a multifamily thing. So we're pretty busy. There we are. And that's our Watertown factory. We're actually getting ready to open a Southwest plant. I can't get too much into the details on that we're, we've toured a couple different buildings. And I think our CEO is flying down there and a week or two to walk through another one. But we have several projects were out on the West Coast that we're looking at building out of our new facility that we're getting ready to open

John McMullen

Very cool. I really appreciate your time today. My congrats again on the BG Flats project. It looks fantastic. I hope you don't run into any more trouble before your opening in August. My name is John McMullen and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.How to Create an 11-Story Building in Just 15 Days w/ BROAD USA 

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Sunny Wang and Jeremy Zimman of BROAD USA. Sunny and Jeremy are here to talk about BROAD's innovative modular manufacturing methods, and how manufacturers can become more environmentally friendly.  So, let's start with you Sunny, tell me about yourself and how BROAD got started.

Sunny Wang

BROAD USA is a subsidiary of the BROAD Group, which is a private company established in 1988 by two brothers. For over 30 years, the core business is commercial air conditioning. After that, we diversified our business to modular construction. The reason is that we had grown increasingly frustrated with the building industry. Not only with the poor-quality standards, but also with the prevalent disregard for environmental production.

So, that's why since 2009, we began to produce prefab construction or the BSB [BROAD Sustainable Building] structure. So, for myself, I have been working with BROAD Group for almost 15 years. I started as a Sales Engineer, and as a General Manager. Now I serve as the General Manager of BROAD USA and was President of the BROAD group.

John McMullen

Very good. Jeremy, tell me about yourself. What's your background and how did you get involved with BROAD?

Jeremy Zimman

Well, thank you for having us today, John, it's a pleasure to be with you. I've worked in and also with China across several industries for the past 20 plus years and I've long followed BROAD. I've been fascinated with B-CORE, which is the material that the Living Building is built with stainless steel material for many years. So, when I had an opportunity to join the company a couple of years ago, it was a slam dunk; I'm Director of Communications.

John McMullen

So, let's dive right in. I've seen BROAD's name quite a bit in the news lately. In fact, I saw a video on CNN's website just last week, showing one of your recent buildings, a "Living Building", as you mentioned--it's a 10-story apartment building--and it went up in less than 29 hours, which is amazing. In fact, BROAD has a history of stacking buildings very quickly and at very low cost. So needless to say, I have lots of questions. First off, tell me more about that 10-story Living Building project.

Jeremy Zimman

So, the first Living Building was built earlier this month, and the time lapse erecting of the building was displayed in the video. So, we built 10 floors in 24 hours, and all 11 floors were completed in a little over 28 hours and that's the assembly on site. All the modules were manufactured off site in 15 days, and then assembled on site in a little over 20 hours. So, it's a 32,000 square foot building, built with B-core our stainless steel structural material, and it was delivered turnkey, including all the electrical and mechanical hv AC. We have our own BROAD outdoor ventilation systems that bring in 100% fresh air from the outside, no return or recycled air. Their electrical power and wiring, lighting all the interior fixtures was completed and ready to move in.

So, our approach to modular construction is to offload 100% of the construction off site. So, when the modulars are delivered, we just do the bolting and connect to the public utilities. While most buildings are static and built to a specific purpose and design, the Living Building is flexible. So, the floor plan, the room layout, even the number of floors can be changed after construction is completed and the building can also be repurposed.

John McMullen

That's amazing. I mean, 15 days is exceptionally fast. So that building, like all of BROAD's buildings as I understand it, are made using with are made with stainless steel. Is that correct?

Jeremy Zimman

Yes.

John McMullen

So, what's the advantage of stainless steel versus some other forms of construction steel?

Jeremy Zimman

So, the use of stainless steel was originally driven by the wishes of our Chairman, Mr. John Ye to cut greenhouse gas emissions. So, carbon steel, and even more so concrete, contributes a lot to global greenhouse emissions in their manufacture. Together carbon steel and concrete is over 15% while stainless steel, which is also recyclable with no degradation of performance; it's probably the most environmentally friendly material. Our B-CORE stainless steel is hardened through a copper braising process, which enables it to be 10-times lighter and up to 100-times stronger than carbon steel. So, we can do creative things like we can cantilever out up to 55 feet. So, it's very strong and very light. B-CORE is also 30-times more resistant to corrosion than carbon steel. So, the service life of this Living Building is virtually unlimited.

John McMullen

Tell me more about the way the modules themselves were designed. In the video I watched of the stacking process, I saw floor panels folding down and window assemblies swinging out; it was a very sophisticated design. Tell me about how that came about.

Sunny Wang     

Okay, let's jump in. For the factory-made modular construction BROAD has developed to since 2009, but the Living Building was the first stainless steel construction. The columns and beams are made of stainless-steel channels and square paths, and the floors are composed of BROAD’s original standards called B-Core Slab. So, the whole building, just like Jeremy mentioned, has no concrete at all. Each model we designed for the size of the 40 feet container, which is 40 feet long, eight feet wide, and 10 feet high. So, the reason we designed this is because it can’t be fitting the shipment, which is frustrating, but actually there is no container needed during shipping. It can extend about two times when unfolded outside for installation. So, it's really realizing the low cost and huge size transportation at a worldwide scale.

John McMullen

So, tell me more about B-CORE. How was it developed and how is it manufactured?

Jeremy Zimman

So, our BROAD sustainable building division, Sunny mentioned was founded in 2009. So, we have a lot of experience in prefabricated buildings. We started with carbon steel from our first factory made building, which was in 2010, until about 2017, when we unveiled B-CORE. So, our Chairman, John Ye invented not only the material, but also the ovens’ kilns that we use in our braising process. So, the stainless steel, is braised at 2,012 degrees. That's what gives it the amazing properties of being very light yet very strong. These ovens went through 10 different iterations. So, there's a lot of trial and error along the way. You know, we invested over one and a quarter billion dollars over 12 years to get to where we are today with the B-CORE material in the Living Building product.

John McMullen

The B-CORE product is made up of two sheets of stainless steel with cylinders inside. Is that right?

Jeremy Zimman

Yeah, it's two stainless steel plates with stainless steel tubes in between the two plates. So, between the two plates, that's called a Slab. It's a sandwich structure, very strong, and the thickness of the plates and the slab itself might differ depending on the application if it's a floor slab, or exterior wall, for instance. Then, those stainless steel tubes, the diameter and the density might change as well. What doesn't change is it's always a sandwich structure. Regardless of where in the building is supplied.

John McMullen

So, BROAD’s manufacturing facilities must be immense, especially for this last building you put up it was created from nothing in 15 days and transported on site. Can you tell me about your manufacturing facilities and the types of processes that you use?

Sunny Wang

Sure. We try to standardize from design to installation, including the production. So, in our campus, basically, and China, we try to achieve all auto streamline production mode. This is for the purpose of quality, mass production, and extremely low labor and material cost. So, all these building structures and other designs totally comply with international standards to ensure all the buildings can be officially approved in different countries. So, for the core size of the production, it's very simple and very automatic. For example, for the sheet metal process, when we do the core tube fabrication, copper foil fabrication, we use kind of rubbers, and that would form the core tube assembly slab stacked up. We use automation in an intellectual, manufacturing way. So, for sheet metal processing line, we can produce around 20 square feet per line, but we only need three technicians for each shift. So that's a very efficient production. For the hot air copper braising, which is a very unique, breakthrough technology developed by BROAD. B-CORE that’s copper braising is hot air treatment. We use blowers to blow hot air into the oven at extremely high speeds and to hit the B-CORE slabs evenly. So that's why we can harden that stainless steel to B-CORE slabs. For this production, we can produce over 10,000 square feet a day, but only use one technician for one shift.

John McMullen

That's amazing. Let's switch gears for a second. I also wanted to talk to you about BROAD’s commitment to the environment. As an industry, modular construction I know prides itself on creating less material waste and being more efficient. But since it started, I've read that BROAD has done a remarkable amount of work to become an environmentally friendly company. You mentioned that with talking about stainless steel, but what else can you tell me about the company itself and the efforts that it's made?

Jeremy Zimman

Well, sustainability, environmental protection, saving energy and saving materials is at the core of everything we do. So not to digress too much, but a flagship product abroad in our 33 years of operation 24 years in the US is an absorption chiller, which is a high capacity central hv AC system. So, our system is not electric, and it can be driven by waste or process heat, any kind of thermal heat. So, for customers within a cogeneration facility or micro grid, they can basically get free cooling, nonpolluting. We use a water-based refrigerant, so there's no harm to the ozone layer. So similarly, with B-CORE and Living Building, we approached it from the environmental protection aspect. Because we migrated 100% of the construction to the factory, we have virtually no construction waste. As you know, construction waste in traditional construction can be 25% or more of material that has to be hauled away, which is very expensive, time consuming and consumes landfill so it's not sustainable. The continued heavy use of concrete is not sustainable for the environment either.

John McMullen

So, what suggestions can you offer other manufacturers who are looking to become more conscious of their impact on the environment?

Sunny Wang   

Well, as Chairman of BROAD Group, you mentioned people can find a real approach to sustainable development for higher life quality and a lower impact on the environment. So that's why under the leadership of Mr. John, BROAD continues to perform its mission to put sustainability into action by replacing as many inefficient products and production process as possible. There's new technology and new ways of applying the disruptive technology which can contribute to reduced energy and resource consumption. Sometimes the perception of the modular building has changed from the cost quality to the sustainability factors. So, I hope all the circles of the modular construction take into consideration how to protect the environment, how to protect humankind’s resources, and make this to be decisive factors to popularize of the modular construction.

John McMullen

So, what’s next for BROAD? What are your goals in the next five years? How do you see yourselves growing? How do you hope to apply your B-CORE product?

Jeremy Zimman

That's a very good question. We recently launched the 1,000 City Strategy based on our Living Building. We will build BROAD pavilions in 1,000 cities across the world in the next eight years and 80 BROAD pavilions across the United States. So, a BROAD pavilion is a mixed-use facility, to demonstrate this new technology, and it includes public space, such as an exhibition hall, conference center, other community space, and residential and office space. So, we also want to use this platform to lure talent to join us, and to trigger developers and architects and other stakeholders to join us to enable modular construction to take up to 10% of the whole construction market. So that that's our goal.

John McMullen

Well, it sounds like B-CORE is a fantastic product. If you're hoping to lure architects and engineers over to modular, I think you've got a great piece of bait for your hook, so to speak. So, before we end, I just wanted to thank you both for recently joining the Modular Building Institute. We're excited to have you here. I expect that we will be hearing lots from BROAD in the years ahead.

Jeremy Zimman

Well, thank you again for having us today, John. We're excited and proud to be members of the Modular Building Institute and we look forward to deep engagement with MBI and all of its members.

John McMullen

I hope so, thanks again and congrats again on a great project and for sharing your experiences with us. I appreciate it. My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Near Miss in New York: How the Industry Dodged a Bullet & What's Coming Next

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Claudia Granados, founder of New York advocacy firm, The Carnelian Group and Jon Hannah-Spacagna, MBI’s Government Affairs Director. Claudia and Jon are here to catch us up on a very near miss for the industry in New York. Claudia and Jon, thanks for being here.

Claudia Granados

Thank you for having us, John. It's a pleasure.

John McMullen

So, Claudia, before we dive in, tell me about yourself and about how and why you started the Carnelian group.

Claudia Granados

So, I have been working in advocacy for about 15 years, really the career that I chose after college. I have been advocating for policies and doing a lot of coalition building. So, my experience comes from working with various corporate nonprofits throughout the country. About two years ago, right before COVID actually, I decided that I wanted to go out on my own because I wanted to build some new and emerging industries that I can take more time and more in depth, to work with them so that we can educate legislators about the new technologies, industries that are upcoming and how we're shaping the future. When you run your own business, you can pick and choose clients that you want to work with. They’re innovative and develop a little bit more time with them. That's why I decided to go on my own. I started my company last January, two months before the pandemic.

John McMullen

Oh, wow. So, it's very new, very new.

Claudia Granados

Yeah. So, although I've been in New York State, specifically, I have been lobbying up in Albany and in the City for about seven years. Before that I was doing work all over the country. I started my work in California, then moved to DC and went around the country doing political and advocacy work.

John McMullen

So now, of course, you're based in New York.

Claudia Granados

Yes.

John McMullen

So, what's the political environment in New York, particularly in regards to labor and construction? What are the general challenges that you face when you're advocating for a construction or labor related issue?

Claudia Granados

You know, it's very good question. The times have changed a great deal since I started doing this work. I want to say about 10 years ago, I was working for then-mayor Cory Booker here in the city of Newark, New Jersey and my work was a little bit different. I was actually advocating on behalf of the city in trying to work through project labor agreements to make sure we had enough work for everybody. Market rate union work, as well as building affordable housing for institutional housing for groups that are held very difficult to house and really creating a space for everybody to coexist. I would say the changes that I have seen are multifaceted.

One is, we have this changing wave of the politics around the country becoming more polarized. We have a lot, we went through a period where there was a lot of work right there, everybody was coming to work. There was a lot of projects in play after the crash of 2008, or almost crash, and so where a lot of the labor force were very intense and doing a lot of public work, because that was the only place that they could get jobs for the numbers. And because we have a robust economy, everything was going well.

Since the pandemic, I think part of the challenge in working with construction and labor is trying to really, again, create the space with emerging industries like modular construction to come in. Do the work, and scale up, while at the same time maintaining that autonomy to be able to produce the housing or commercial buildings in a factory that oftentimes are not related in the local level. So, a lot of the trade. One to go and push a lot of the legislators and say, well, everything has to be done locally.

Well, that's not always the case. When you have a housing crisis, the way that we do now, which is very acute here in New York and in California specifically, we have to find new models, new ways of doing business. So, part of what I see of the challenge is trying to make sure that the people that we're advocating to the legislators understand that in order for us to build and be part of a solution to build more affordable housing, transitional housing, to deal with the current crises, we have to be able to create a space for modular construction to flourish. So that often means, yes, we're going to have work that is located in different states and that is done in a factory. That's where we didn't do cost savings. It doesn't mean that labor is shut out of it.

So, part of this is trying to position ourselves so that they understand that we're not taking their work, because in many places like New York and California, because of a union density vary, we'll be able to still have some of the work. I think that's the biggest challenge.

John McMullen

So, Jon, I'm going to turn to you, what can you tell us about this specific issue that MBI has been dealing with in New York and what is MBI trying to accomplish?

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI.

John McMullen

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Brent McPhail of Brave Control Solutions. Brent is here to talk more about the potential of automation in the construction industry, and how it specifically can benefit the modular construction industry. Brent, welcome back to the podcast.

Brent McPhail

Thank you, John. Glad to be back.

John McMullen

For those who did not hear our previous conversation, tell me briefly about yourself and about Brave Control Solutions.

Brent McPhail

Sure. So at a high level, I own a company called Brave Control Solutions and we develop automated solutions for manufacturers. Historically, we've built a lot of equipment for the automotive industry for manufacturing, as well as some food and beverage and, general industry. About three years ago, we started to make a pivot towards automating for construction. And as anybody who's listened to this podcast already knows, it's the next wave of the future for the modular and offsite construction industry. So, we've developed a number of solutions and systems for the offsite construction market.

John McMullen

So the last time we spoke, we talked about automation in general and the obvious potential benefits for modular construction. But, there are significant challenges to automation, especially for buildings, right?

Brent McPhail

Yeah. So briefly, I guess we with a previous podcast sort of focused on was what we called Snowflake Manufacturing. From our experience in traditional automating for manufacturers, and then into construction automation, one of the things that we learned early was this little quick little analogy I talked about, which is the F 150 story. The F 150 is a very complicated piece of equipment. However, you would never build a factory without knowing each and every component that's going to go into that f150. When you look at the construction industry, and what we call Snowflake Manufacturing is before your first factory is built, you've already designed a new building to run in that factory. While there's a lot of parallels between the two industries, there are some unique and significant challenges with offsite construction that we've got to address specifically.

John McMullen

So what are some of the specific hurdles that you as an automation company face with construction projects?

Brent McPhail

So a specific hurdle would be the flexibility challenge. So because of the nature of the way that we build these Snowflakes, we have to build automation that's able to react as quickly as a consumer demand reacts. As a new building comes in, as an architect is designed a new type of building, we need to make sure that we can leverage as many tools as we can to sort of change our fixturing and have our robotic systems able to adapt to handle that flexibility. One of the things that we want to talk about today is this term that gets thrown around, which is designed for manufacturing. I hear it said, but when you want to design for automated manufacturing it adds an even additional layer to a subject that architects are already sort of struggling with in the modular industry.

John McMullen

So what ideas do you have to help design and automation sort of meet in the middle?

Brent McPhail

Basically, in a perfect situation, what we would do is we would adopt the offsite construction industry to make everything exactly the same. So there would be no variability, every building would be the same. Then we could use our traditional automation methodologies that we use for, say, making cars. Of course, that's not possible. So then the other side is the construction industry would come to me and say, Brent, we need you to make a machine that is 100%, flexible, like a Star Trek replicator that can make anything that we demand. That's far off in the future so that's also not possible. In order for us to meet in the middle, we've got to find that area where there's enough flexibility in the product that the consumers will buy it and that the architects can continue to build it, but also that there's not so much flexibility that we can design automated systems to work in that environment.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So it sounds like there really needs to be a change in thinking maybe for design professionals, architects in particular. What suggestions do you have?

Brent McPhail

Yeah. What I would say is that the challenge that I see coming down the road is that when I hear the term of “design for manufacturing” thrown around, I think that what's happening right now is architects that are working in the modular industry, they're savvy to this. They’re smart people. What they're doing is they're now going down to the floor and they're asking the framer, or the welder, hey, this last project I designed, why are you guys putting more hours into assembling it? One advantage they have is that that guy is incredibly flexible and he's incredibly resilient. So if they don't do the best job of designing for the manufacturing process, they can still accomplish that process, it just, you know, make somebody's job a little bit worse. And so that's kind of the situation that we're at right now. The humans have the flexibility to pick up the slack, the architects have the time to start to learn what they need to do to help them that design for manufacturing.

When we move to the next step, which is designing for automated manufacturing, robots are incredibly flexible, but they are not very adaptable on the fly in situations. If we don't consider the design for manufacturing of that robotic cell at that time, we have to then bring in humans to make up the slack for the robots are. And so if you can imagine the investments that a company has made in putting robots in a system, and then to have to go back and use a human, to basically pick up the slack, because that robot doesn't have that adaptability on the fly. There's a lot of frustration there. And so us as robotic designers, what we are trying to push, and what we're trying to say is okay, guys, but if you work with the robotic designer, to help create the envelope of what needs to be the flexible requirements for your system, then you have something that you can design within those parameters to be able to get the best out of your automated system. And so it's a lot smoother, but it takes a lot of conversation at the beginning.

John McMullen

It sounds like it. What would be the process for implementing these sorts of changes in the short term?

Brent McPhail 

So what we've been doing is we, my company specifically, you know, we go through this solutioning process where we define the requirements. So what that means, and what this is driven by is that, you know, there's a lot of smart people, architects, specifically, that are making really bad choices right now. And so the question you have to ask is, why would a smart person who certainly doesn't want to make his job harder, or anyone else in this organization shop harder to make a bad choice, and the reason is, because they can't see it. So when you think about, you know, traditional automotive manufacturing, there's nobody that, you know, you're not designing a car to work in a factory, that's never been done before. Even when Elon Musk is making his factories, he's still using techniques that have been around for 50-60 years of automation. So you've got this designer who is in the automotive industry who comes in, and he knows that in order for him to get over the parts located in all the gaps and everything correct, there's a whole bunch of detailed work that happens behind the scenes. Behind the door panel, if you peel that door panel off, you see all kinds of locating pins and holes and things for the robots to grip onto.

Well, architects don't see that because that's not their past. And because we don't have a pre-existing system to show them that. So what we do is we try to get the details required for the project at the high level. And so the mins and maxes, some of the basically the business rules or the design rules, that's the starting point. And then what happens is, we have to then make a concept of a machine at a very high level that we can put into a digital twin or digital model so that we can simulate so that the architect can now give us better feedback, as we're designing this machine.

Once that machine has been agreed upon to work within the parameters that are given, then what happens is the architect has the ability now to see it, he has the ability to do a design, to put it in this virtual environment and try it and test it and see what the robot's limitations are see where you know, a limitation or robot, for example, would be a reach. So you've, you've decided that you want to put two structures a few inches apart, while the robot might be a foot and a half wide. And so if it can't reach inside that area, he can't perform that task. And so then that means that that automated system is going to be instead of 100% completely automated, it's going to have to have some manual intervention component. Well, if you can't see that, and you can't visualize that you can't make a better design choice. And what we're finding is that the architects look at it, they say, Well, I don't have to put that structural piece there, I could put it over here and it would have the same effect from what I'm trying to achieve. But from the automation side, it then gives them another piece of that puzzle that can be more fully automated.

So giving them that environment. And it is early stages. So it's sort of you know, the opposite of a good design really, but but it's where we're at right now, because of this early nature is we give them the ability to trial and error, their design in a virtual environment instead of trial and error and on the actual floor. There's there's ways we can do it better in the future. But this is the stage that we're at right now that we're finding is working pretty quite successfully.

John McMullen

What's that process been like communicating with architects that you've been with? Have they enjoyed this process? Have they looked at this product and said, hey, there's a lot of potential here. What's, what's the feedback that you've gotten so far?

Brent McPhail

Yeah. So So generally what happens is, they know the challenge, they know the problem. And we all know that it's happening right now. And it's, we don't have generations to wait for this, right. It's, we can't pass this tribal knowledge down. So so they know the problem. Generally, what's happened is there's a lack of communication, because the manufacturing guys are sitting apart from the architecture guys, which are sitting apart from the automation guys. So what we're really pushing for is to have that conversation upfront.

The way it's been happening now is the manufacturing guys guide, and direct us on how to make that machine that first step of the process, the mins and the maximums. And the architects aren't necessarily involved in that. And so then what happens is, when the architects do get involved, they don't realize the limitations of the machine. And so they're busy doing their design. And so we end up with a machine that's capable of running, say, 80% 70%, automated and the rest has to be done off site, well, then that'll facilitate the meeting with the architect, the architect will then sit down and say, Well, if you guys had to show me these rules ahead of time, then I would have able to, you know, make better design choices. And so as they go into their next project of their next project, the quality of the quantity and quality of how much they can automate goes up.

So that's been historically what we've been sort of seeing so far. What our push right now is, is now that we're aware of this is to just get everybody in the room that needs to be in that room up front, so that they can see what's going on, so that we can show them how to use the tools and so that they can start off making their designs better. But But to be honest, there's a an active business cases going on, where a lot of times when we get involved, a building has been sold, it's already partially designed. And then people are trying to scramble to manufacture it. So you know, it's not that I don't feel that it's people aren't doing it wrong. It's some of it that they don't know. And some of it is just market driven, business driven. like everything's working in parallel, instead of you know, nobody has time to line everything up in the perfect order. So so that's just an iterative process that that we go through.

John McMullen

So I asked you about the implementing these changes in the short term. So what's on the flip side? What what's the ideal that you guys are striving for? What's the long term solution?

Brent McPhail

Well, so the long term solution is a couple of different things. First of all, as we learn, and as we keep developing applications, we're able to make our robots do more and more and more things, right. So it's still very early days. So in the longer term solution, there will be less limitations. But I really don't see a point where we eliminate all the limitations. So the part that I would like to change, I guess, in sort of a longer term as we get get through this is that, instead of us giving the architect sandbox that he can try his design and see if it passes or fails, we need to integrate with the data systems with the BIM models, we need to integrate with sort of the tools that they're using to make their design decisions the same way that they would, you know, from a cost point or a bill of materials point, we need to build in the design limitations of the automated system at that point. Now, the reason that's such a long way away is the same as we're at right now. It's just there's, there's a lot of balls up in the air. And that's a lot of integrated work. So So we believe we've got a short term solution right now, that's a visual tool that will help the architects design better once it's been established. But I believe the long term has to be how do we not even need that too? How do we just limit his choices at design time, so that they work with the automation?

John McMullen

So here's a fun thought experiment. We've had the benefit of seeing lots of other industries evolve into automation over the past century, you brought up automobiles, and we're just getting to the point now, where we're automating building construction. So tell me about modular construction in 50 years, how does that work?

Brent McPhail

Yeah, so 50 years from now is going to be almost impossible for me to predict because I think the rate of change of our technology, it's, it's exponential. But it is an interesting question. So I can talk about where I can see sort of this, you know, the modular going, and what I would say is that, what I found is with, you know, technological innovations, we always tend to overestimate in the short term, what their impact is going to be. But then I believe we underestimate in the long term of what their impact is going to be. And so, you know, I believe that Brave is a front runner in developing some of this technology, but I know that we're not alone. And I know that as the market demands that there'll be more companies like brave in the next three to five years that are jumping in with their own version of their CAD the fab product or their, you know, sort of digital twin design tools.

So what's going to start to happen is we're going to see a lot of changes really quickly, what I believe is that in traditional manufacturing, there's a movement to start to go towards a decentralized model. And so what the modular construction industry is doing right now is they're sort of following the path of traditional manufacturing, which is a centralized model, big factories, pumping out product, and then shipping the product. And, you know, there's always a debate of, you know, 3d volumetric versus 2d, do you ship or do you not ship there, but I think what's going to happen is that the beta is going to start to change. And as you see, people that are putting up, you know, 500 1000 2000, house subdivisions, and then they move, you know, after a year or two to the next site, and they do the same thing over and over again. But there's going to be a demand for a more mobile, modular factory that not only provides flexibility in the products that it can produce, but it provides flexibility and where it can be established.

And so I have this vision of transport trucks that are flatbeds that we connect together that have a structure that forms sort of our factory bed, and we input raw materials into those transport trucks, and then we spit out the product that we want, right localized at the jobsite. So that's kind of my at some point of time on that. I mean, we have the technology to do that right now, I don't know that we have, we don't have the market for it. But I think as housing costs go up, and labor shortages increase, you know, that changes the game. So we can be three 510 years old, as we're starting to build these type of applications and the more decentralized manner.

John McMullen

Well, I love that idea of the the mobile factory, I know some of our other members, rent spaces, you know, they don't have a centralized factory, they rent buildings, they create modules, close to the job site, but I really liked the idea of one that you put on truck beds and you take wherever you need it. I'll be honest, though, I was kind of hoping you tell me in 50 years, we'd have Star Trek replicators, because I'm really looking forward that.

Brent McPhail

Well, we will but but it's hard to sort of quantify that. And it's certainly hard for people to understand it. But when I talk about like it sort of in our traditional manufacturing discussion, you know, there's been some talk, there's been some talk that in this decentralized model, what you're going to end up with is a factory where you just input raw materials. And so those raw materials, whether you're, you know, using 3d printing technologies, and that 3d printing, in a lot of ways, our 3d volumetric machine is actually just a 3d printer. It just doesn't use the traditional, you know, melted wire or lasers to form the gallery. It basically just uses, you know, a methodology where it takes the CAD data, assembles the fixture assembles the product, and then facets it together using other robots.

So in a way, that is a very, very, very, very crude Star Trek replicator, it is as we get more advanced, and we start to say, okay, we're going to put glass into this factory, we're going to put wood into this factory, we're going to put steel into this factory, and we're going to start making windows and structures and these other things, but it's just sort of like a raw materials in and the kind of product. But we're obviously a ways away from that. But I think that's that's the future of manufacturing. You know, broadly speaking,

John McMullen

I love it. Maybe one day, we'll get some Earl Grey tea hot with it. I'm sure my friends will get that one.

Brent McPhail 

Ha! Yeah, exactly.

John McMullen

So what do design professionals and manufacturers need to do today to prepare for this future that is rapidly coming upon us?

Brent McPhail

Yeah, so actually, we did touch on it a little bit, where I think we need to sort of bring the parties together sooner. So there's certainly a more collaborative look that we want to have at the design of the machine, the design of the product, you know, as I, as I talked about the architects, they really, up until this point, have only really focused on, you know, the aesthetics, the structural, the space utilization, you know, the business case, but now there's this design for manufacturing component that they're working on with the modular aside. And it's only going to get deeper as we have, you know, we've got more restrictions, with the robotic systems that are going to require more choices. So so there's certainly a collaborative approach.

The other thing I think that design professionals need to do is they need to accept that there is a paradigm shift. This is not a minor change in the way that we're building things. This is a major change. And so I think that it's easy for us to just say the words Yeah, yeah, we know it's gonna change, we know that this is what's going to happen, and we're cool with it.

But that's just words, really, this is a monumental paradigm shift in the way that we are going to manufacture buildings. And so I don't know that there's really a call to action there other than it's more of a like, buckle up your chin strap and get ready because it's a big shift. It's a big change. And, and then I think just having an eagerness to be on the front of that wave, right. So there's a lot of frustration, a lot of pain, a lot of mistakes happen on the front of that wave, but there's a ton of excitement and a ton of opportunity there as well.

John McMullen 

I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity. It's just a matter of how we get there and how soon we get there. So tell me about what BCS is working on now. And what's in the pipeline.

Brent McPhail

Yeah, so. So since, you know, we kind of got our feet wet in 3d, volumetric, we've continued to refine different fastening applications. So instead of just welding, we've now got an application that's doing some screwing, nailing, gluing. We're working on clinching, which is a forming of metal and some different types of welding techniques. So we're doing some application development there.

We're doing some consulting with a number of clients that one thing we didn't touch on is that while design for manufacturing is kind of the current challenge we're facing, there's another challenge in manufacturing, which is what I call the manufacturing organizational structure. And so that's another topic maybe for a future podcast, but but really quickly, that's just, you know, manufacturing doesn't just happen. And so we've got to prepare our clients that you're not just building a construction job site under a roof, there's a complete different philosophy in the way that we manufacture within an organization. And so that's a different thing.

So we're doing some consulting there, we've got an interesting machine right now that we're building, which is to do copper pipe cutting, processing, and fascinating to help a plumbing contractor. So save them a lot of time with their kidding. And then the volumetric we're working on some projects, that's not necessarily 3d volumetric. Now, by using the same concept, the same sort of flexible precision, automated fabrication methodology to work with cylindrical type of objects, and in to the, to the object. So, so I mean, a lot has changed within brave in the last, you know, three and a half years from, you know, not being involved in the construction industry, to building systems for the construction industry to now, you know, developing and innovating new types of systems to solve challenges that, you know, we weren't even aware even on our radar three years ago. So it's very, very exciting times for myself and my engineers.

John McMullen

It sounds like there's tons of potential there. We're excited to have you guys as members. Thanks so much, Brent, I really appreciate your time today.

Brent McPhail

Well, thank you very much. I appreciate your time as well. You know, I love these podcasts because it's always a good time for me to even get my thoughts out that are swimming around in my head. I have to sit down and organize it so it's very enjoyable for me. Thank you.

John McMullen

Well, I look forward to talking to you again. My name is John McMullen and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Creating an Industry-First Standard Contract for Modular/Prefabrication w/ ConsensusDocs

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Brian Perlberg, Executive Director and Senior Counsel at ConsensusDocs. Brian is here to talk about the new contract ConsensusDocs has created for modular projects, how it was developed, and all the benefits that it can provide for modular project stakeholders. Brian, thanks for being here.

Brian Perlberg

John, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

John McMullen

My pleasure. For those who aren't familiar with ConsensusDocs, who are you guys? What do you do? How did you get started?

Brian Perlberg

Well, ConsensusDocs has been around since September of 2007 and we publish best practice, standard construction contract documents. If you're not familiar, contract documents, standard ones that associations identify, draft and publish, play a really important role in setting the rules, the playbook for the designing construction industry. Standard documents have been around for over 100 years and it's almost like private legislation because it's not like there's a one size fits all approach. Again, what's in the contracts usually represents roles, responsibilities, and what you kind of expect from general ground rules on a project, the do's and the do nots often. One of the things I like to say is, you cannot say general contractor without saying the words contract. You can't say the word subcontractor without saying the words contract. Contracts matter. The studies prove it. And we're really happy that we're all about changing and improving the industry, and to set a better foundation contractually on how to build both from a legal point of view, but also best practices.

John McMullen

So what's the scope of your services? What kind of contracts you offer? How many do you offer?

Brian Perlberg

Yeah, and so I should mention that ConsensusDocs is the Docs in the docs has a double meaning by the way. It stands for designers, owners, contractors, and subcontractors. What that is intended is that we are trying to bring the entire industry together to figure out a better way to build. One of the ways we do that is while we publish, so to speak, just standard contract documents, there's a lot of them. They again, play a really important role. We address all major project delivery methods. By that I mean the traditional method of design, bid, build, which you're probably most familiar with, that is still the most prevalent way of designing and contracting. We also address design build, which is a pretty substantial way of delivering projects, cm at risk, as well as cm agency, as well as we were the first to come out with a standard integrated project delivery document. In addition to that, we have a lot of other agreements like sub contracts that support those main project delivery methods, as well as particular emerging issues like building information modeling. We’ll get into it later, but like the first to publish a prefabrication construction contract document. So the answer is I kind of liken it to the commercial. It's a little while now. Maybe I'm dating myself, but remember the one for Prego spaghetti sauce? If you need a contract document, it's in there in our contract catalog. Just like the spaghetti sauce had all the main ingredients that you need for a great meal.

John McMullen

So, tell me about the coalition that you guys have put together. You alluded to it earlier. MBI is a member, proud to be one, but why is it so important to bring all these voices to the table?

Brian Perlberg

Well, it goes back to the history of how a standard contract document. Historically, one association writes a contract document and publishes it. A standard document is probably going to be more fair than something written what's called bespoke, or a manuscript, a document, which is a one off, or maybe it's even a public agency that's writing it for themselves. Those documents sometimes are what I call Frankenstein contracts; in the sense that they're sewn together from the dead body parts of all failed projects. They usually have a risk allocation profile of shifting all of the risk from one party to another. That's not good and that's one of the reasons why our industry struggles with efficiency is because proper risk allocation is that the party who is in the best position to manage and mitigate risk, should be allocated that risk. Globally, you can take an IPD approach and try to manage risk holistically at the project level, and everybody managing and mitigating that risk. Here's the thing, if one association writes a contract document, who do you think people are going to think that it's bias towards? If the American Institute of Architects, AIA, writes a contract document do you think it's going to be advantageous to the owner? Do you think it's going to be advantageous to the contract? No, you're going to think it's going to favor the AIA membership, which is their mission is to further the interests of their professional society. That's all fine and good, but the problem is standard contract documents set the ground rules. It works a lot better when you have predictability in your terms from one contract to another rather than people taking one standard, 40 page contract document and saying, this doesn't benefit me, I'm going to delete almost every single word in this contract. I'm going to make it so it's biased towards me. Then you're playing game and ship where you're trying to figure out, gotcha, contract, gotcha how you're going to get the short end of the stick in the contract.

So ConsensusDocs came around. The concept was, okay, we get it. If it's written by one association, even if it is fair, people are going to perceive it as bias toward that group. So let's get rid of this Gordian knot problem by a bias, and we're going to get everybody an equal seat at the drafting table. So we invited everybody. Owners, contractors, subcontractors, design professionals. I’ll admit, initially the design professionals, because they've had an outside role in controlling the terms and conditions and their professional authority in the process, were reluctant to participate. It's taken a lot of effort to get their perspective to the table and adequately representative, which I think we have. The point is, everybody has an equal stay at the drafting table. The end product is geared towards having a better contract document that someone at the project level can take from the national level, take it off the shelf and pretty much put the project specific information in and feel like they have balanced the risk in a way that's designed to do one thing, get better project results. We do it in a way that's really innovative, where we've gotten everybody into this mindset and we've been able to take a leadership role on addressing emerging issues that are impacting our industry for the better. I can't think of a better example than the prefabrication contract document, but we've done that in lots of areas.

John McMullen

Well, that's a fantastic lead up to my next question. Thank you so much. So about the prefab contract, MBI worked with ConsensusDocs for two years, helping to create this new contract. I was wondering if you could tell me about that development process.

Brian Perlberg

Sure. The conversation started because a member in AGC, who is a very active participant in the ConsensusDocs coalition, Sue Cloans who was with Gil Bane, was the chair of a working group. I believe it was for offsite modular or prefabrication group about improving the industry and I'm getting the name wrong. Tom Hardiman was on that group and actually was the vice chair when Sue was the chair and later became the chair. She asked me to come in and talk about contract documents because I'm sort of the go to person for contract documents in the construction space. We started a conversation of this is really important. This is a way of improving the industry. One of the ways that I think ConsensusDocs, our competitive advantage is we're active listeners. We haven't been doing this for 100 years. We have a good track record, but we're open to new ideas and we want to do new things.

Tom and I got to speaking and I think that after getting introduced from this offsite group, I think it was a process improvement for the industry that also included Nibs. I think maybe Nibs was staffing it. I think that there was a meeting with MBI and basically, we created this concept of, let's address prefabrication construction. We took that idea that the ConsensusDocs Drafting Council, and there are representatives from 40 groups. MBI became the 41st group so now I can say 40 plus organizations. The concept was approved enthusiastically. Then what we did is we worked with folks through MBI, through Nibs, and through the ConsensusDocs coalition. I would actually say that this was one where ABC in particular was great at getting us volunteers. We sent this open invitation to a lot of people who are knowledgeable, not just in contract documents, but are knowledgeable about prefabricated, modular construction and different aspects of that. We had lawyers, we had people who were very knowledgeable of the industry, and we got them together. First, we talked about concepts and philosophy. We talked a lot about what are we seeing in the industry that are gaps? What are the problems, usually, when we try to write an industry first document? There's a dearth of, of examples and the examples we get usually are not examples that we want to emulate. They're usually horror stories in which people talk about how I can't believe I worked on this project. This is what we had to deal with and this was not the right fit. So, it takes a while to figure it out and I can go into a little bit more detail about our process, but let me pause there to make sure that I'm answering your question.

John McMullen

No, you did. It was a great answer. Thank you.

Brian Perlberg

Sure. So we start the process and it did take about two years to write a contract document. I bet your listeners are probably thinking, wow, that's a long time to write a contract. We do have a pretty exhaustive process, because we start big and then we narrow it down. Like I mentioned before, there's sort of a philosophical approach and then there's getting down to brass tacks. We had an all-star cast, a really complimentary focus group that really was of the mindset of how do we figure this out to make the industry better? It was really interesting. This issue was particularly interesting because of some legal precedents of dealing with manufactured goods versus common law. That's governed by the UCC, or the Uniform Commercial Code, and then there's a whole host of common law issues that are more typically governing construction contracts, and the design and construction of something that is a one off. So we spent a lot of time thinking about, what do we want? How do we want to handle this? Is it more of a manufacturing process? Is it more like construction and a subcontract? That's why it took a bit of time. Then we started getting down to model language.

It was really interesting because it was the philosophy then it was the language. We had so many pivot points to make because prefab presents some novel issues. The biggest one is the UCC versus common law and how that plays out on things like prepayment or paying a payment of the goods before they're made and warranty issues. It is fascinating and it takes a while but the two years was well worth it, because after some fits, starts and going down not rabbit holes, but maybe going down one hole and then trying to verify if that's the right way to go. And not sure of yourself because it's an industry first document and there's not a lot of examples out there. We were able to get some good feedback from folks who have the general contractor's perspective, the pre fabricator perspective who is more like a manufacturer, distributors and things of that and end users and lawyers. It really was a good process. Then there's the ConsensusDocs process; we're not going to just publish a document. We have the working group and then it goes through the ConsensusDocs Council that makes sure that the terms and conditions are consistent with our other documents. There, we're allowed to have particular issues that are addressed differently for a specific issue, but we also want to be consistent. So there's a balancing act. The roster of the Council of ConsensusDocs also reviews that separately from the working group. Then we have to publish and edit the documents, put it in our system and make sure that all of that sort of value-added things that we do to make sure the documents work in our system. They automatically renumber if you make revisions, and where the blanks are, where you have project specific information. Then we even publish a guidebook that are ways of trying to think through some of the risk allocation issues that may vary from one project to another. Lo and behold, we got through all of that. We got through the approvals, we got through the logistics of publishing the document, then the rollout marketing effort. We're real happy that the two year process was successful and led to a really good document. The document is the ConsensusDocs 753, the standard agreement between constructor and pre fabricator. That is our standard document for prefabrication.

John McMullen

Well, that's awesome. I know a ton of work went into it. I know Tom's proud of the work that he did, that MBI did. I was wondering if you could help me just so everyone understands: if I'm an MBI member, a manufacturer, or a design professional... how does this new contract benefit me?

Brian Perlberg

Well, the first thing is it helps put prefabrication and modular construction on the map. I said before, you can't say the word general contractor without the word contract. Some people say, how do we identify? Oh, it's so unique. Everybody who does prefabrication does it differently and that's true, but there are some commonalities. There's the you don't want to have to start from scratch, kind of like prefabrication, you want to have some standardization, and you want to be able to build off of that. You want to be able to build it off of a standard contract template. So we have identified the most common way where we think that offsite modular and prefabricated construction is going to be designed, procured and contracted for on a project. If we didn't use the subcontract model, it's going to be procured through the general contractor. We can talk a little bit about some of our future plans on making some other variations that are maybe less common types, but still widely accepted ways of procuring prefabrication.

The first rule is that putting a standard document on it is something that is an industry standard that everybody can point to and think through. It's something that you can react to and you can identify, okay, this is the example of how ConsensusDocs describes the process contractually, and even beyond that of prefabrication. Now it's a reference point in education materials for the industry, lawyers can use this in reference points, and then it kind of becomes a little bit of a buzz. Well, this must be important if it's in a standard construction contract too. Maybe this is something that I should be looking at. ConsensusDocs is saying that there's a lot of advantages using contracting for prefabrication. Since they're saying it, maybe I should be looking into this for my next project.

The other thing that benefits MBI is that they are recognized they had an equal voice at the table. They've become a ConsensusDocs coalition member. All MBI members get a 20% discount on purchasing the contracts for use on projects. Then there's guidebook comments that MBI contributed to. They get to be part of the official guidelines of how you need to think through some of those risk allocation issues on a project specific level. Then the future is open. I mean, this is not an endpoint. This is a destination along a longer journey of addressing prefabrication in construction.

John McMullen

So this contract is still very new. Have you gotten any feedback yet from anyone who's used it?

Brian Perlberg

We've gotten tremendous feedback. I should mention some of the folks who were involved. The chair of the group is a good friend of mine who is really active in ConsensusDocs and his name is Ron Ciotti. He had a lot of clients who had asked him to, before the standard document was written, help them work through their contract issues. Either as the prefabricating being the client or someone who was an owner or general contractor who wanted to use prefabrication. He would have to work on those from scratch and he took that knowledge. We took the ConsensusDocs 750 long form subcontract as the basis for thinking through and making modifications for something for prefabrication. Ron was instrumental MBI was instrumental and Nibs was instrumental. Ron has been very active in this area and I've gotten great feedback of it, but he's actually done a lot of in person presentations and virtual through MBI, through other groups and there's been a lot of notice of this document.

One is that there's a thirst for addressing this issue contractually, because a lot of times legal issues become a reason not to do something. People will be interested in using, say prefabrication. If they don't have an answer, the lawyers are often in the position of saying, well, that's a great idea, but I think we need to put the brakes on this because we don't have this question answered. So now that we have a standard document, there's been a lot of reception for it. It's been very well received both the fact that it's the first standard document and then how we addressed some of these issues that had not been addressed before. We've gotten tremendous feedback that it's got a lot of notice, particularly in the modular and prefab area, obviously.

John McMullen

So what's next for ConsensusDocs? Are there other modular friendly projects in the pipeline? You said that this is a starting point for you guys. Do you have sort of a roadmap ahead?

Brian Perlberg

So, we have over 110 standard contract documents and as important as prefabrication is, right now we're in the midst of something pretty important to us. About every five years, we update our standard terms and conditions that are embedded into most of our agreements. For those of you who are familiar in the contract documents world, the AIA 201, is updated once every 10 years and that's a separate document. That's their terms and conditions. We integrate our terms, conditions and agreements into one document. So we're in the process, that affects a lot of our contracts, of looking at our terms and conditions and thinking through. Okay, in the last five years, is there anything that has changed in the industry? Have we gotten any feedback? Are there any new case law? Is there any new legislation that we need to revise our documents to make sure that they reflect best practices, not just in today's construction, but in the near term future?

So we're going through that process and that will have impacts for all of our agreements. An example would be, what is the language that you use to address say consequential damages and liquidated damages? That's one of the issues that we're going to explore whether we want to make some fine point refinements to the language we have in our terms and conditions. Let me put a period there and say, yes, we have other plans. Consecutive with that process, is creating different versions of the 753 Prefabricated Construction Addendum. We would make those that have different numbers be different documents. But they would reflect different ways of the general process of off site modular and storing the materials off site. But in a particular place in the same site as the prefabrication site. There are different models and scenarios that do raise other legal aspects. There could be more integration potentially, of the prefabrication facility and the project is one scenario. There could be less integrated approaches, where you have multiple sites that are storing the materials, some of those issues, change the legal requirements that you want to address, or you need to address in your contracts. And so we were thinking of creating different versions and to address different scenarios for pre fabricators and purchaser of prefabrication. In in their contracts, so that would be creating a getting the gang back together, creating a working group. that's similar to The all-star cast that we had, and then going through the ConsensusDocs process again. But it would be this time we'd be starting from the 753. And just making modifications to it, based upon industry feedback based upon usage. And based upon these different scenarios that we would then publish, instead of just one contract document addressing prefabrication, we'd probably have a total of four different versions.

John McMullen

I'm sure those be well received and I'm sure Tom would be excited to get back with everyone who worked on 753. Again, I know he was he was proud of that and excited that it's finally been released. Thanks so much for your time today, Brian 753 contracts sounds like a great addition to the ConsensusDocs portfolio. I really appreciate your time today.

Brian Perlberg

Thanks so much for having me. If I can be of any assistance, feel free to reach out to contact me at Bpearlburg@consensusdocs.org. We have a lot of free resources on our website, you can actually get a free sample copy of the 753 by registering on our website and requesting a sample. If you need help, we have an 800 number as well. I think this is a great opportunity for the MBI members to have an additional resource and hopefully it will be a reference in your convention materials and education sessions that you have for years to come.

John McMullen

I just wanted to remind our listeners before we go, MBI members are eligible for a 20% discount as Brian mentioned earlier. Just contact us here at MBI for details. Brian, thanks again.

Brian Perlberg

Thank you John. Have a great day.

John McMullen

You too. My name is John McMullen and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Hello and welcome to "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Cliff Hokanson, Executive VP at HHI Corporation. Cliff is here today to talk about HHI and the medical triage units they've developed in response to COVID-19. Cliff, welcome! How are you today?

Cliff: I'm doing great, John. Thanks for having me on this podcast. This is great.

John: It's my pleasure. I also wanted to extend a warm welcome as very new members of MBI.

Cliff: That's correct. We are so excited to be members. The Modular Building Institute is just a great opportunity for us to expand what we've been doing for the last 50 years and just expand into doing modular building along with everything else we've been doing.

John: Well, welcome! Thanks for welcoming us. So, let's dive in.

About HHI Corporation

John: Tell me about HHI. How did it start?

Cliff: So, 50 years ago, HHI started building cabins in Utah up in the mountains. My mom and dad were the founders; they started the company and started building cabins. About two years after they started the company, they started doing federal contracting and industrial contracting, where we did a number of different projects for the Department of Defense. And a lot of stuff in... So, a number of years, we were building lots of different projects, and for the last 30 years, we've been doing a lot of chemical and biological testing facilities across the country. So, we get along with that. We also build a lot of buildings, hangars for airplanes, and all kinds of support structures that would be required for anything that the Department of Defense would use, either Air Force or the Army and the Navy. So, we've been doing a lot of work like that for 50 years.

As we've been going about doing all this work, about 15 years ago, we started building modular airplane maintenance stands. So, you kind of see the construction site over 50 years being developed. About 15 years ago, we started doing in-house construction or fabrication of aluminum and steel structures for maintaining planes like the C-17 and C-130 and air fighter jets like the F-16 and helicopters like the Apache or the Chinook and the UH-60 helicopters. So, we do a lot of projects, and our products that we manufacture have gone across the world.

John: That's kind of amazing, starting with cabins in Utah and now being involved in all these different aspects of construction and manufacturing, especially for the Department of Defense. That's really fascinating.

Cliff: Yeah, it's been quite a journey, and it's amazing to see how the company has evolved over the years.

COVID-19 Challenges

John: Absolutely. And speaking of challenges, with the past few months and everything we've been dealing with COVID-19, can you tell me about the challenges that HHI has faced? What's changed?

Cliff: I think, for us and for a lot of everybody else, we've had the problem of getting supplies. Our suppliers have had COVID hit their supply houses or their fabrication plants, and they have shut down, and we have not been able to get some of the materials that we needed. And that's been a game-changer for some places where only one manufacturer manufactured the materials we needed. And we just had to go back to our clients and say, "Hey, the manufacturer, the only manufacturer, can't get it to us, so we can't finish the project." And we've had to reschedule, and that's been extremely difficult. But they've been understanding for the most part. We've been really good.

But the supply chain has definitely changed, and we've had to go to different markets across the country to get new supplies. And then, as far as in-house, we used to do a lot of meetings in-house. We are very virtual. We've done a lot of virtual meetings because we work around the globe; we've been doing it for years. But we've, where we had clients close by, we'd like to meet with them, and we've changed it to where we don't see them that often. Even our inspectors on critical sites, we've had to do some type of a Zoom meeting or GoToMeeting or just a FaceTime, where we should be able to show what they wanted to see before we closed up something.

So, the world's changing, and we've been very fortunate to be able to adapt quickly, and most of it we were already doing, so it was easy for us just to move forward in. But there's definitely some challenges. We have some new stringent policies here on our campus. We have about 85 people on our campus where we manufacture, and we make sure that they have, every day, we go through a COVID test, a screen, to make sure that they are clear and they're good to basically work here. So, it's different; you know, we didn't use to do that, now if we kind of do it kind of at a necessity.

Inspiration

John: Absolutely, yeah. It's been a challenging time for many, and it's great to hear how you've been adapting. Now, speaking of COVID, what inspired HHI to create the mobile triage unit? Was it entirely new, or was it based on previous work? How was it designed? Tell me more about that.

Cliff: That's a great... I guess the inspiration came a few months before we started. A little background, so we built a container called a containerized biocontainment system for the Department of State a number of years ago when Ebola broke out in Africa. So, when that happened, the State Department was given some money, and with that money, they wanted to come up with a way to bring the doctors and nurses home who were going and treating patients for Ebola in Africa. So, it was about 2016, 2015, about five years ago.

And they contracted with a partner of ours to get some... to have us fabricate this container that would hold and contain Ebola patients, four patients, and doctors and nurses, keep them all safe, and transport them on a C-17 or a C-5 or a 747 cargo plane and ship them home. That background is kind of interesting. Why were we qualified? For the last 30 years, we've been working in a chemical-biological arena, and we're one of the best in the world at building containment for chemicals or biological problems, stuff like anthrax, ricin, Ebola, so high-level bio-contaminants. So when you heard about COVID, they said, "Well, it's really not that infectious of a disease compared to anthrax or at a high level." So when we kind of heard about the COVID, we said, "Well, we could do something about it."

But we found that the ship that was in the Japanese harbor, the cruise ship, all those patients from the United States got shipped home on a 747. The ones that weren't infected were in the seats that you saw in the pictures. But next to the picture was our box. It looks like a shipping container. It's not a shipping container. It's very expensive. It has a biocontainment system, which basically you walk in and you can decontaminate the people. You walk in, you get locked in, you can decontaminate the doctors and nurses, and you can keep the patient separate. And it's very sophisticated. We build them with a partner of ours that specializes in biocontainment systems for the Department of Defense, and this unit was designed. So, we built 50 of them for the State Department, and we were able to put them on these cargo planes and ship them overseas.

COVID-19 Response with Mobile Triage Units

John: That's really interesting. And it's fascinating how your previous experience with these high-level bio-contaminants and containment systems kind of translated into something that could be used for COVID-19. So, can you tell me more about the mobile triage unit itself, how it works, and how it's been used in response to COVID-19?

Cliff: Yeah, that's a great question. So, we have our partner, which is a subsidiary of ours, it's called ISOVAC, and they make the containment systems for us, and they're the ones that kind of developed the product for us. We reached out to some clients that we were already working with, and they wanted to ship it on a cargo plane. And so, that's kind of how it was developed. It's got a shower in it. So, when we get a patient, the first thing you do is you go in and you put your patient in the unit, and you isolate the patient. So, we've got an isolation room where the patient's room is isolated. And that's great because you can go in and out of the unit; you can go in and see the patient, and they're isolated. So, you can just, if they need to be isolated, you can isolate them in there. But when they get in there, we can shower them off with our shower system. We can decontaminate the unit. We can take the patient out, and we can take the biocontamination system out. And all that's included in the unit. So, the shower is a real big deal because once they're contaminated, you don't want to touch them, and you want to be able to shower them off and get them clean so you can take them to a hospital or a care facility that's close by.

John: That's really important, especially considering the contagious nature of COVID-19. So, how have these units been received and utilized by healthcare facilities or organizations? Have you seen them in action?

Cliff: Yeah, that's been... The Department of State took them to Africa, and they were able to transport a lot of patients, get them in the unit, and get them transported safely home to get treatment. Here in the United States, we have clients that are using them. We've sent some to New York City, sent some to Alabama, Arizona. We've got a number of different clients that are using them. So, they can transport patients. They've got, as I mentioned, all the decontamination systems with showers, and they're able to transport them to a care facility safely. That's been great. I think, for the most part, everybody's pretty happy with them. We were able to move on it fairly quickly, and we think they're great. So, they've been working really well for everybody.

John: That's great to hear, and it's fantastic that these units have been able to be deployed so quickly and effectively to help with this crisis.

Cliff: Yeah, we were fortunate to be able to use what we already had. When the COVID came out, we just had to adapt it a little bit and go forward. So, we were able to... We thought that was kind of our duty.

Modular Construction

John: Absolutely, and it's great that you could adapt your existing technology and expertise to meet this new challenge. Now, shifting gears a bit, HHI has recently joined the Modular Building Institute. Can you tell me more about the role of modular construction in your projects and your experience with it?

Cliff: Yeah, we're pretty new to the Modular Building Institute. We've just started with you guys, and we're excited to be here, and we think it's a great opportunity for us. We've been manufacturing buildings for 50 years, but most of the buildings have been site-built. About 15 years ago, we got into the market of manufacturing airplane maintenance stands and these bio-containment systems. And so, we had to figure out a way to manufacture them, and we thought, "You know, maybe we can put it on wheels." We had this partnership with this company, ISOVAC, and they specialize in manufacturing bio-containment systems. So, we were able to get together and put a unit together that had a shower, an isolation room, and all the decontamination system. We could manufacture that. We could put it on wheels, and we could ship it, so it had its own transport. So, it was easily transportable. And so, we've got a number of clients across the country that have picked it up and are using them in their facilities. So, for us, that was a natural move.

Future of Modular Construction

John: Absolutely, and it's great to see how modular construction can be adapted and applied to different sectors and different needs. So, looking forward, what do you see as the future of modular construction, especially in light of your experience with these mobile triage units and your partnership with MBI?

Cliff: Well, I think... I was thinking about this. I think we've got... It's a great opportunity. When you've got these COVID-19 situations or these healthcare emergencies, I think a lot of people are starting to realize that you need to have some type of flexible system. And the nice thing about modular construction is you can build them and you can put them anywhere. And you're able to move them. And that's where I think it's a great opportunity. I think the future is really bright for modular construction, especially with the adaptability of the units. You know, you can use them for healthcare facilities, like we've got. You can use them for airplane maintenance stands, which we do. There are just so many different opportunities, and the sky's the limit for modular construction, so it's a great opportunity for everybody.

John: Absolutely, and it's exciting to see how modular construction can continue to grow and adapt to meet the changing needs of society, especially in these times when flexibility and adaptability are so important.

Cliff: Yeah, we're excited to be part of the association, and we look forward to working with you guys more and having a lot of success with modular construction.

John: Absolutely, we're excited to have you as part of the MBI community, and we look forward to working with you as well. Cliff, thank you so much for joining us today and for sharing your insights and the great work that HHI is doing with these mobile triage units. It's been a pleasure talking to you.

Cliff: Yeah, it's been a pleasure being here, and thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it.

John: My pleasure. And thank you to our listeners for tuning in to this episode of the Modular Building Institute podcast. We hope you found this discussion informative and insightful.

John McMullen

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm joined by Gary Badge and Manny Lamarche with FK Architecture. Gary and Manny have returned to talk about how FK has incorporated modular into their overall portfolio and about their new efforts to design more sustainable modular structures. Gary and Manny welcome back.

Gary Badge

Thank you, John again. Good to be back.

John McMullen

So since there's two of you, let's introduce yourself so everyone knows your voices.

Gary Badge

I'm Gary Badge, managing Principal at FK Architecture.

Manny Lamarche

I'm Manny Lamarche, a Senior Designer at FK Architecture.

John McMullen

Excellent. So you guys have been on the podcast before, catch us up on the past 10 months. What's been going on at FK Architecture? A new name for one thing!

Gary Badge

Sure, absolutely. It's been super busy, super crazy. We unveiled the new logo, as you mentioned, and the new brand. It's been very successful. It's been eye opening process a lot involved with it. It's exciting. It's gotten us into new endeavors that we didn't even know existed. We've got lots of compliments. Our clients or friends have complimented us on refreshing our look and image. And we've attracted a lot of new attention, especially with our social media platforms or website. So that's been pretty fun and it's been part of our whole, the whole means and methods of diversifying, getting into new markets and just expanding what FK is about.

John McMullen

That's awesome. What props to your marketing people. I know that rebrand takes a lot of work.

Gary Badge

It sure does and we did it all in house too. So that was even more challenging. But we've had a lot of great people here and, you know, we thank them.

John McMullen

So how have you and your colleagues at FK made to transition to modular design? I know when we talked late last year, you guys were just getting going. Has it been a smooth process?

Manny Lamarche

So far, so good, but it's lower than Gary would like I think. Lately, it would seem as if there is a greater awareness about modular technology, and we have been approached to investigate adapting current products to modular applications.

Our most current modular effort involves repositioning a tiny house concept that we had prepared for a large resort developer into a boutique hospitality product incorporating modular components. This approach is unique in that we have been tasked with coming up with a hybrid solution bridging on both on-site and off-site technology technologies, as well as potential implementation of prefabricated components that would plug and play into the finished product.

So at FK Architecture we continue to explore how best to adapt our traditional way of thinking about building design to achieve greater efficiencies and tangible value to products that we design and build.

John McMullen

That's awesome. I want to come back to some of those specifics. I have a more general question to start off with though. Since you guys have done traditional architecture for a long time and have just now begun to incorporate modular, I was wondering if you could speak to the design process and how it differs between traditional and modular. What are the inherent challenges to each?

Manny Lamarche

When we examine the big picture of technological evolution, we may notice that the human experience is always in a constant flux. There was a time when you needed a key to open up a door. Today, you may use your mobile phone to achieve that goal. Just like the world of electronic innovations, modular technologies have been around for a long time. As it relates to residential products, it has been at least 100 years since the first modular and prefabricated ideas were floating around and as we can see, it is fast approaching its primetime. The constant pursuit of greater efficiencies, in both project cost and resource management, tends to drive innovative thinking. Thus, economics is ever present in everything we do. There is always a fine balance between acceptable quality and the cost of a particular design solution.

So as we continue our exploration in modular technologies and have in depth conversations with builders and investors, we're starting to notice an evolution in our way of thinking about these things, as well as a greater sophistication in the understanding of this modular field by individuals in the more traditional on site construction industry. That said, I would suggest that the greatest difference between designing for on site versus off-site construction is the mental process of your viciously pulling apart the individual building blocks from the building as a whole. Thinking in terms of functional compartments or modules, reminds me of the bubble diagrams we used to do while conceptualizing a building during the initial stages of the design process. Except that in the offsite universe, those bubbles retain the structural integrity as part of a total module product that by design must travel to its final destination.

At FK Architecture, we see only advantages with implementation of modular thinking and technological strategies in order to deliver higher quality for the money to the markets we serve.

John McMullen

So speaking of these contemporary methods, the evolving technologies that you've alluded to, I was wondering if you could speak specifically to modular design. What are the potential benefits not only for designers, but of the projects themselves?

Gary Badge

Well, there's been a few guys that I've spoken to recently and I think the benefits is how we organize the project and become more efficient. Modular itself, it's about efficiency, it's about repetition, it's about quality control, sustainability. So all those things are playing into how we're doing our documentation, how we discuss things, our contracting team, they’re still learning.

We're over here on the eastern seaboard, where we haven't seen a lot of modular, so its not a lot is going on. They're still trying to catch up, but it's a more organized conversation and there's a method to the madness. Like Manny said, when he have everybody in the room, from the onset of the design process, you're getting a scope out early, you're getting everybody's questions early, division of disciplines, and who's responsible for what is getting done early. And that all plays into how the fabrication ends up at the end of the day.

So it's pretty helpful, it's pretty unique. It differs from how we do a conventional project because you don't always have everybody in the room at the beginning of the project. You know, we tried to do kickoff meetings, we tried to get everybody going. But at that time, still there's something left out or something that drags on. With modular, you got to press that you got to have these questions answered early on. So we're exploring ways that we could even have more flexibility. That's kind of the difference for me.

Manny Lamarche

I think it is very interesting as we speak with builders, that are the guys who have to deal with all the challenges of information that doesn't show up on the drawings or is misinterpreted by subcontractors. It's interesting to see how they start to understand and speak about the possibilities of modular thinking and fabrication to bring efficiencies to the products that they do, or even altering the very foundation of the product they do.

Gary Badge

You know, one of the big things we're talking about too, is in labor. The quality of the labor, the labor shortage, I mean, that's in every industry. That is something that we've been hearing all over from all clients and all sectors. The last three conversations with contractors have been specifically, how can I overcome my labor deficiencies? They feel having the controlled modular environment is going to be an answer to that problem. The waste material, that's another thing that they talk about, how many mistakes are made, how much extra material you have to buy and the cost of materials or how to control these days so that they're trying to be efficient, They’re trying to still deliver the project on time, on budget. It's a good product that people are proud of, and it's going to stand up for a long time. So modular is helping bring that awareness to everybody. It's weird, because the discussions come up so much recently, whether it's because we're engaging that deliverable more or people are just catching wind of it, but it's definitely been talked about a lot. In the last 10 months, we've had a lot of discussion. So, I’m feeling pretty good about it.

Manny Lamarche

Yeah. These are people that have been doing the same on site type work for decades. In many instances, they are the ones that somehow know that Gary has been talking and Theresa, maybe they listen to the podcast or flown by the Institute website. It's no longer a secret. It’s something that's becoming, hey, I'd like to learn more. How can I use this technology to do better?

Gary Badge

Yeah, that's the question everyone's asking.

John McMullen 

So when you talk about the efficiencies that modular brings to the table, the less waste that's generated, it goes back to a point you were making earlier about sustainability, really, all of these factor into sustainability. I was wondering why you find that to be so important. How do you define sustainability when you're talking to contractors, when you're designing products? I'm curious how you define that term.

Gary Badge

Well, we're introducing it more and more. There was a movement, years back, with the Green Building Council and everybody getting LEED certified, LEED accredited, pioneering everybody to save the planet kind of thing. From my standpoint, it's my own personal opinion, I don't think it went in the direction that made a whole lot of sense. It became something that was a specialty kind of a group, it costs some time and some money to be involved and engaged in it. Lots of developers and contractors didn't catch on because it wasn't part of their cost analysis. It costs more to be sustainable. Sustainable to me is to be respectful of your environment, to work within your environment. The world is not a place that we can neglect and that's all we've done as a species, in my opinion. There's symposiums every day, there's news every day about weather events and catastrophic things that are out of our control, temperatures and sea levels and everything like that. We're running out of land, we've got more people, there's got to be a better way to integrate our existence with our canvas and the world Earth, that's our canvas, that's what we live in. If we can’t integrate with it, and we just keep recreating it, and having our own agenda, it's going to spit us out like we're a virus.

I mean the world is doing that back. It's like, I got to rid myself of this. It's a challenge and to get people to understand it is hard because it takes a certain kind of mindset. It takes the ability to adapt to change, and people won't gravitate towards change naturally. Last week, I was at the lodging conference, and I gave a speech with some fellow panelists about this same very topic. I talked about how modular could benefit and could be part of the solution for how we can integrate with the environment better, how we can have less impact on how we're doing things and building construction practices. It’s evident because you're building in a controlled environment, so your carbon footprint is smaller, you're able to control the amount of material that you're building with, how many cuts it takes if you're doing wood or steel, how you're putting things together is done more systematically than in the field. And because of that, you have less waste, you need less materials and IE you're not impacting the environment as much. You're also doing your site development during that phase. There's less disturbance, you're not on site 14 months. You're on site to do your initial area development and then within a period of time your modules arrive and within a few weeks, you've got the product up and running. You're getting your CO and you're out of the door. Conventionally though, you've got machinery running a lot, you've got disturbance of the land, you got noise pollution and your emissions are not controlled like in a factory environment.

So it's really important to me, and I guess it hasn't always been now I've adapted to change. Just flying in and out of Orlando here, I've seen, we used to have a lot of trees and now we don't have so many trees, but we have an awful lot of people and an awful lot of buildings. Our state is an easy target for building and construction because we don't have mountainous terrains or anything to overcome that's challenging from that standpoint. It's pretty flat, it's easy to build on, but I think we're going to be quickly realizing that we have to do things differently, because it's not going to last forever. You might not be thinking about yourself today, but you’ve got to be thinking about your children and your children's children and everybody else for years to come and how they're going to use the environment. Whatever practices we do today will set the precedent for tomorrow.

John McMullen

So you touched on this just now, but I wanted to revisit just quickly. How do you quantify your sustainability efforts when you're talking to clients? What metrics do you use to help a project become more sustainable?

Gary Badge

Well, I think I rely mostly on the MEP engineers to talk about that in terms of the life cycle cost analysis. Your initial costs are probably not going to be seen, but your long term costs are going to be seen. If you're using solar energy or more efficient kinds of energies instead of using the split system condensing unit farm, for instance, you're going to see that you're using less energy over time. Therefore you're spending less money on energy. When we talk about just the building materials themselves and we talk about how we're doing with wood for instance, we have a lot of clients that want to do wood construction, which if it's done right, you can replenish the forest, but we've got so much building going on, I don't know that we are doing a good job with that. So we talk about, how can we design the building in a way that uses less material? That's a way to quantify and less material, in turn talks about cost. That is always a topic of discussion with anybody that we're engaged with, you know, what's going to cost? How much is it going to solve the budget?

Unfortunately, I think sustainability, whether we're talking about quantifying it or whether we're just talking about it in general, it needs to be thought of a little bit differently. It's about the survival of our species. When we're doing a project, it's affecting that, especially new construction because most of what we're doing in our world is new construction. We tried to promote clients to look at repositioning existing buildings, and we try to find sites where their project might work with that. We do a lot of planning as well when we're at the forefront of the project with the owners, and when it's searching out for land. We'd say hey, maybe you could do this differently, maybe you don't have to clear 60 acres, maybe you can do less acreage and get more units. There's many hurdles with that, right? Because we also have to deal with the jurisdiction and codes require a certain thing. You have to educate everybody. It's not any one entity that has to be committed. Everybody has to, and the only way that that works, is by talking about it, by collaborating, by sharing, by getting out there having discussions like we're having today, and just peeking people's interest.

John McMullen

So are there any specific suggestions that when you're talking with other designers, or new designers, people who are learning the craft? What suggestions do you have for them when they're looking to create more sustainable structures?

Gary Badge

Well, I think one of the ways that we're doing it is we write sustainable material product methods into the specifications. So once it becomes part of that, it's sort of a gospel, not everybody follows it, there's always a bidding and negotiating point. If you're getting it in there early and you're shooting for the maximum amount of things that you want in a project early, chances are you might be able to save it by the time you're done going through the process. So, that's one way that we're doing it.

Manny Lamarche

What we've noticed is that not too long ago, when you talked about sustainability, sustainable strategies, there was this general understanding, I guess, that you might be at record right now. I think that in the last few years with the flooding in Europe, the fires in California, more people are understanding that something happened to the environment and it's not just a normal curve of just nature doing things. Clearly, there is some type of input that we are injecting into the equation. It starts to make people think, well perhaps we need to reevaluate the way we do things. So, when that relates back to the building industry, that's what I see. A certain curiosity from what you may consider traditional builders opening their minds to exploring other alternatives. At the forefront of that is modular design and fabrication. So in the factory, there is an ability to better manage resources, so indirectly you start to apply green thinking into how you can make more money. The ultimate effect is, if I don't have to spend that much more and get an equal or better product, why not do it? So, that's our natural way into modular thinking, publication and planning.

Gary Badge

So, specs and then introduce the discussion about modular. A different deliverable altogether. Those are ways that we're educating and starting conversations with other design professionals and developers to consider sustainability.

Manny Lamarche 

Then, sustainability equates to the fabrication economy.

Gary Badge

You’ve got to show them what can they put their hands on today so that they understand. They may not understand tomorrow. I understand well I'm not going to have a blue sky forever. Florida is going to become a sandbar at the point of Orlando and the rest of it is going to be gone because it’s sea level. I mean it's real life issues that people neglect because if it doesn't affect me then I don't care. It doesn't bother me and is it coming out of my pocket? No. So I don't I don't necessarily think about it.

Manny Lamarche

Our core business is intelligent entertainment. It's hard to entertain and be hospitable when the world around you is on fire or wiping out towns.

Gary Badge

I mean, that's adventurous.

Manny Lamarche

Right? So, I think it makes sense for everyone who is involved in sustainable practices, both on the construction side and on the planning side, money making side of the planet. I think that modular construction just gravitates to that. Well, I can do better by changing the way I think about how I build. Right?

John McMullen

Well, this is a good segue. A lot of this conversation has been about sustainability, using less materials. Manny mentioned exploring new ways to build and I want to go back to one of the topics you mentioned at the beginning of our conversation. You guys mentioned that you were working on a tiny home concept. I was wondering if you could expand on that, sort of define that for people who aren't as familiar and tell us about what you're doing?

Manny Lamarche

Sure thing. We're currently tasked with developing a concept package for a tiny house idea we had originally created for a separate development. This time around the market demand is for a bit larger footprint to be rolled out in a completely different geographic location and with a different demographic profile. I would say that the most peculiar aspect of this effort is that our client’s strategy demands a hybrid counterpart that would be factory made here in America, then shipped to site using conventional flatbed trucks for offsite assembly. We're now in the initial stages of defining this concept and so far it has been well received. This hybrid model, with a combination of onsite and offsite strategies, appears to be a good scheme to introduce modular thinking in those regions where on-site construction is currently the dominant industry. An important finding is the key interest shown by traditional manufacturers of products destined for the onsite market, and who are curious about adopting such products for offsite implementation.

So we're witnessing this interesting phenomenon of cross pollination of knowledge and skills among construction related industries, always with the aim of doing something more efficiently, more economically, or faster from idea to market while better managing waste and quality control. We remain hopeful that an increasing number of our long-term projects will slowly but surely transition to offsite type developments, as owners realize the extraordinary benefits that modular construction brings to the table.

Gary Badge

Yeah, what Manny is talking about is, they saw a need, the need spoke to them. They've been wanting to do something different for a while, the client happens to be a builder as well and he wants to take this product mainstream. The need is for more affordable housing solutions. That seems to be prevalent nationwide. Now in our own backyard, our mayor said, “By the end of my term, I hope to have 11,000 more housing units developed. We've got this greater need and it's growing every day.” By looking to the modular industry, this particular client said, well there's a way I want to do it and there's a way I've got to sell the idea to the people that I'm working with. He's looking at public private partnerships to get this thing executed. When you're doing that, you got to sell the idea. In order to sell the idea, he's thinking, what are some of the key challenges in modular construction today? We've identified through our discussions that it’s not an infallible process. It has a lot of merit, a lot of promise and people doing it successfully. That's what we're trying to educate everyone on, but there are some inherent things that come up that. The other side argues well I can fix that in a conventional setting. So if you want to make some changes later in life, something happens where something doesn't get aligned where it necessarily needs to be; how can I make that modification without it costing the entire project? Whether it's for the duration or the success and a buildable mess of it.

So what he's done is he said, what about a hybrid solution? Why can't we analyze and develop our partial things that are modules of plug and play and get apart that we can put on trucks, bring to the site and erect with a couple of guys in a couple of weeks. The way that he was seeing it was okay, well, I can deliver one tiny home or two tiny homes, three tiny homes at a clip and I've got to get more trucks to do it. I've got all those logistical concerns, though he's looking at it from a whole solution standpoint. How can I reduce my delivery? I put more units on a single truck at a time, instead of doing a bunch of individual ones. How can I overcome the logistics of this trucking industry, that trucking industry or whoever you're sourcing. So, that became kind of a motivator. I guess in a weird way, we talked about IKEA. You put all your furniture together sort of modular, it's not the best. The way that it comes packaged, the way that you could be delivering it, you can deliver many units at a time instead of one at a time. That’s something that we want to overcome.

So, that's one thing that we're looking at. That's unique because our initial studies were on fully developed module; it was a whole unit, it was an apartment setting. So it wanted to be finished and delivered, and crane, all that. This is different. This is a kit of parts that can be done quickly with the same labor force that they're thinking of using. As I said earlier, labor is an issue, skilled labor is an issue. If you don't have to have a specialty crew putting something together, you've got a better advantage and you're in a better position to build with this type of deliverable. So that's something that I think is prevalent in the discussion that we weren't initially thinking about. It's altering the design to the point where we're looking, how do we then do sub modules? How can we continue to do kitchens and baths? We still don't want to have to be doing a lot of conventional onsite construction. How can we still implement other modular practices, get this thing to work and still unfold? So those challenges, those sets of criteria are setting us up differently for this project type. We’re just scraping the tip of the iceberg now. A lot of people in the industry that we're talking to about, how are they able to help us? Whether they're manufacturers of FF&E or if there's something like the shirt pod. The shirt pod was at the logic conference last week and they're actually here in Orlando. They do those pods of bathrooms and kitchens. It’s just a unique feeling.

Manny Lamarche

So I think what we're learning is that, depending on the market segment, there are certain practices that work better than others. For example, when we started, we started with a farmer and the conversion from onsite to offsite modular technology with a purpose. That seems to be the best approach, but this tiny house component is for a boutique type resort. We'll make this the foundation system, the flash modular components, is more appropriate for that particular market. It was a true hybrid system where about half the building is finalized, then there are components like the master bathroom that will come directly, fully assembled in a factory and it would be just as good.

Gary Badge

As I said, it's not just here in Florida, it's a nationwide issue. As we were talking earlier, you’ve got different geographic regions. It might not even be possible to supply a fully developed module apartment or tiny home because of the terrain, but you could bring a kit of parts up there just as you would conventionally, except you've got the majority of projects already built. Those are the kinds of things that were forward thinking. It's different. It's trying to take what's out there, perfect it and use it in a way that satisfies a lot of challenges.

John McMullen

Well, I think it's a great concept, particularly for affordable housing. That's a theme that's been popping up regularly not only on this podcast, but across the industry. There’s a huge need for affordable housing coast to coast. This sounds like a great solution to help alleviate at least some of it, particularly in Florida and places where I know there's a need. Switching gears just a little bit with this idea that you guys are helping to pioneer and all the other efforts that you guys been making recently, FK has been making quite a splash lately. Your name is out, you've been in our magazine Modular Advantage, this is your second podcast and I heard you did some work with Habitat for Humanity down in Orlando. Congratulations first of all. Second, I've got my fingers crossed, are you guys going to be at World of modular in April?

Gary Badge

Absolutely. We plan on being there and we plan on continuing discussions with the Institute. It's been a great success, lots of networking, and I'm looking forward to it. This past year was interesting with the way it was dealt with COVID, but we got a lot of mileage out of that. I think being in-person is going to be even more successful.

John McMullen

Oh, excellent. I'm glad to hear that.

Gary Badge 

Thanks. I appreciate it.

John McMullen

Well, I just want to thank you guys for your time. It's been a fantastic discussion. I know there's a lot in store in terms of sustainability practices and benefits of modular that have yet to be fully realized by the industry. I appreciate your time today. I hope we can do it again.

Gary Badge

Yeah, it's our pleasure. We love talking.

Manny Lamarche

Thanks again for having us.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.View From the Top: An Interview with MBI Board Chair Brad Gudeman

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Brad Gudeman, Vice President at Maryland-based Modular Genius and chair of the Modular Building Institute's board of directors. We'll be talking about what it means to be a member of MBI, and we'll highlight the important initiatives that members--and the industry-at-large--can look forward to in the months ahead.

John McMullen 

Brad, welcome.

Brad Gudeman 

Hey, John, thanks for having me. Look forward to talking with you.

John McMullen 

Oh, it's my pleasure. I should tell you, you've been a bit of my white whale this year. I've I've been talking with Ed, your director of marketing, I think for six or seven months now about getting you on the show. So I really appreciate you being here.

Brad Gudeman 

Oh, absolutely. Glad to be here.

John McMullen 

So tell me about yourself, Brad. How did you start in the modular construction industry and what led to you becoming the chair of its trade association?

Brad Gudeman 

Good question. Well, I was given the opportunity to support sales and marketing for a large modular leasing company back in the mid 90s, then I transitioned into a new role establishing their storage container division in the mid-Atlantic US. I managed that fleet, as well as having a role in sales. I still remember to this day my crowning achievement was leasing 1000 units in a single year!

Brad Gudeman 

Transactional sales were fun, but I was more interested in the modular project business. I worked for a couple other modular companies prior to starting our business. Our business, Modular Genius, was founded 15 years ago with my two partners, Damon Pross and David Vanicky. Our mutual desire to stay involved in the industry was solidified by becoming an MBI member in 2006.

Brad Gudeman 

My involvement with MBI led me to being nominated as a trustee for the Modular Building Institute's Education Foundation in 2011. And I want to explain for the audience that's not aware: The Education Foundation is a nonprofit that works for colleges and universities providing scholarships and design competitions. We have had a successful partnership with the American Institute of Architects students. Ten years later, I still involve my time with the Foundation. My involvement with the Foundation was a contributing factor for my nomination as a board member of the Modular Building Institute. I joined the board of directors in 2014. And it's an honor to be part of leadership for members and the industry.

John McMullen  

Well, that's great. And thanks for bringing up the Education Foundation. I haven't talked about that much before. We haven't had any guests who spoke to that before. I remember last year some fantastic projects came through. So we should dive into that sometime soon. It's definitely worthy of an episode, I think.

John McMullen 

So you've had all this experience in modular construction and you've started Modular Genius. Tell me more about your role as board chair, though, what are your responsibilities now with MBI?

Brad Gudeman 

Yes, well, as MBI Board Chair, I'm actively involved in meetings throughout the year. As part of the executive committee, we report certain strategic initiatives back to the Board. As part of the nominations committee, we provide recommendations to the Board, which will be presented to MBI membership, once a year at World of Modular--at the business meeting. Throughout the year, I sit on several council and committee meetings and participate in quarterly board meetings. There might be a meeting or two, I'm forgetting. But it's a good bit of work staying engaged.

John McMullen 

And what can you tell me about the last five to 10 years? How has the modular industry itself grown?

Brad Gudeman 

Yes, MBI membership and interest has grown exponentially. You know, we have 20-plus countries around the world participating in innovation, design, and construction of some of the most eye-popping modular projects to date. I think whether you go back five or 10 years, I can say the bar keeps getting raised. The key is speed to occupancy, that that just keeps getting shorter with these projects. And then the designs, they keep getting more complex, and then the size of the buildings, they just keep getting larger.

John McMullen 

And what about MBI? How is MBI grown over that same time period?

Brad Gudeman 

Wow, yeah, it's grown big time. With the interest internationally, there's been quite a mix of projects entered in our annual World of Modular's Awards of Distinction. Attendance is more than doubled since my involvement in 2006. So that's, that is really awesome.

John McMullen 

So from your perspective--you're sitting sort of at the top of the hill, so to speak as board chair--what's MBI's role in the industry at the moment?

Brad Gudeman 

I hate to sound like a textbook, but for listeners who aren't familiar with the mission of the MBI, I'd like to read it.

John McMullen 

Sure.

Brad Gudeman 

As the voice of commercial modular construction, it's been MBI 's mission to expand the use of off site construction, through innovative construction practices, outreach, and education to the construction community and customers, and recognition of high quality modular designs and facilities. So, I mean, that's the mission. But MBI's role goes way past that. MBI wants to grow the market share in the construction industry, I mean, period. That's what we want to do. We have documented 5% growth over five years recently. And I know the momentum just keeps getting increased.

John McMullen 

So with with the growing momentum with the growing interest, we've talked about MBI's big event that you mentioned it a couple of minutes ago, World of modular. It's MBI's signature trade show. But I personally have only attended one; that was back in 2020. And of course, last year's was all digital, which was a great experience, but digital. What's your experience been like as a manufacturer, and as an MBI member in general?

Brad Gudeman 

This is my favorite time of the year with my work family. It's a time of the year when everyone is in the same place. We can have perpetual business meetings and laughs about life all at the same time. As a member, our company takes the opportunity to tighten up business relationships in person, or create new ones. It's a must. If you're a newbie, and you want to be there and are afraid that you're just going to be standing in the corner. That won't happen for long. It's very welcoming. It's very engaging environment. And if you're a digital attendee, get a nice, comfortable chair, kick back and be prepared for information overload, which is a good thing. There's so much covered. You will you want to go back and rewatch any recorded sessions again,

John McMullen 

I was wondering if, since you've been to several, far more than I have, if you could speak just for a second to what it's like to be there. We're going to be back in person. Next year, we'll be in San Antonio, at a beautiful resort. But I was wondering maybe specifically, if you could talk about the expo hall, or all the other little networking functions that take place over those four days. For someone who's never been, if you could just describe a little bit more what it's like to be in those rooms.

Brad Gudeman 

Sure. Well, let's talk about that expo hall. That is the room where you have access to manufacturers, suppliers, finance companies, just a huge network of companies that are there to show their wares. Talk about what they've done and what they can do for your businesses. And it's, it's just a great spot to have some good one on one for our business modular genius. It's a time of the year that we reflect on all of our accomplishments. And we select projects that we want to enter into To the awards of distinction, we look at the right photos, we do a technical write up. And we really get everybody involved in our business to give it our best in our entry. We've been fortunate over the years to be recognized by the judges, we value our awards. They sit on our lobby of our corporate office. And it lets us share with our visitors, our passion for modular construction, and most importantly, the recognition of MBI. For our hard work. Every everyone that is a member should enter as many projects as possible. I enjoy looking at the entries and get ideas from them. You know, there's only one way to further the industry and, and that is to share and build off of other people's experiences.

John McMullen 

I think AOD is probably one of my favorite parts of the year. I love seeing the projects come in, they've already started coming in, which is fun to see the the awards dinners, a lot of fun. I know, as you said, modular genius has received a lot of these awards over the years. So kudos to you guys. And so for non members, I think the big news for this year is that non-members actually can enter the Awards of Distinction, which we hope brings in a lot more entries and a few more eyeballs. Why should a company enter--you know, you've got these awards, as you say, as you come in the door, you see all the awards that Modular Genius has won--what's the value of entering for non-member?

Brad Gudeman 

You're going to have to hold on John, no problem, but he is somebody printing on our large format printer. I'm hiding hiding in the back, back room. And now this huge printer is going off.

John McMullen 

[Laughter] Not a problem.

Brad Gudeman 

My goodness...Wait, just hold on one sec.

John McMullen 

Okay.

Brad Gudeman 

All right. When I start that question over

John McMullen 

Sure. Let's see...what are the value of these awards? Why should a non member enter?

Brad Gudeman 

Well, MBI provides tools that you can apply to your operation strengthens your ties to your customers and the community is served through the different facets of MBI, such as government affairs, the industry recognition at the world of modular we just discussed, networking leads the advertising research, we have training and education, there is a directory access to everybody's contact information. And then there's the MBI publications that are the bi-monthly Modular Advantage magazine, and then the annual reports for permanent modular construction and relocatable buildings. So just a whole variety of things to support the business, the best way to get involved with the MBI. Just raise your hand if you have interest in getting involved, visit modular.org, and, and reach out to us. We'd be happy to plug you in to the right area of interest.

John McMullen 

What are your hopes for MBI over the next five to 10 years?

Brad Gudeman 

I hope MBI membership will double again and members exposed to the public becomes so mainstream that it will cause a significant shift in how we design and how we build our planet. I hope one day we can say modular is no longer the minority of construction projects, but rather the majority. And MBI members will continue to push the envelope of what can be constructed off-site, whether a project is looking for permanent modular construction or relocatable building. And MBI is the leading trade association. And I'm proud our company as a member.

John McMullen 

And so speaking of your company, I'll bring it back home for you: What does 2022 and even beyond look like for Modular Genius?

Brad Gudeman 

Well, when I brought up speed to occupancy earlier on, that is just making more opportunity for modular genius, especially in the education market, with relocatable buildings for just the population growth and speed to renovations with buildings. And then the permanent side there are needs by owners for buildings and they want to get in them fast. They've got money to spend, and we'll help them do that. So 2022 is shaping up really nicely. The pipeline is very healthy, and we're really blessed.

John McMullen 

Well, Brad, like I said at the top of the episode and we've been trying to get this scheduled for a long time, I really appreciate your time. I know you've been very busy, which is great. But I'm happy we finally got to chat and I hope we can do it again soon.

Brad Gudeman 

Yeah, thank you, John, and thank you for everything you do for the MBI in marketing. You do a great job.

John McMullen 

Oh, well, thank you. Thank you very much. And if I don't see you before, I will see you in April in San Antonio, at World of Modular.

Brad Gudeman  

Fantastic. Looking forward to it. Take it easy.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.View From the Top: An Interview with MBI Board Chair Brad Gudeman

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Brad Gudeman, Vice President at Maryland-based Modular Genius and chair of the Modular Building Institute's board of directors. We'll be talking about what it means to be a member of MBI, and we'll highlight the important initiatives that members--and the industry-at-large--can look forward to in the months ahead.

John McMullen 

Brad, welcome.

Brad Gudeman 

Hey, John, thanks for having me. Look forward to talking with you.

John McMullen 

Oh, it's my pleasure. I should tell you, you've been a bit of my white whale this year. I've I've been talking with Ed, your director of marketing, I think for six or seven months now about getting you on the show. So I really appreciate you being here.

Brad Gudeman 

Oh, absolutely. Glad to be here.

John McMullen 

So tell me about yourself, Brad. How did you start in the modular construction industry and what led to you becoming the chair of its trade association?

Brad Gudeman 

Good question. Well, I was given the opportunity to support sales and marketing for a large modular leasing company back in the mid 90s, then I transitioned into a new role establishing their storage container division in the mid-Atlantic US. I managed that fleet, as well as having a role in sales. I still remember to this day my crowning achievement was leasing 1000 units in a single year!

Brad Gudeman 

Transactional sales were fun, but I was more interested in the modular project business. I worked for a couple other modular companies prior to starting our business. Our business, Modular Genius, was founded 15 years ago with my two partners, Damon Pross and David Vanicky. Our mutual desire to stay involved in the industry was solidified by becoming an MBI member in 2006.

Brad Gudeman 

My involvement with MBI led me to being nominated as a trustee for the Modular Building Institute's Education Foundation in 2011. And I want to explain for the audience that's not aware: The Education Foundation is a nonprofit that works for colleges and universities providing scholarships and design competitions. We have had a successful partnership with the American Institute of Architects students. Ten years later, I still involve my time with the Foundation. My involvement with the Foundation was a contributing factor for my nomination as a board member of the Modular Building Institute. I joined the board of directors in 2014. And it's an honor to be part of leadership for members and the industry.

John McMullen  

Well, that's great. And thanks for bringing up the Education Foundation. I haven't talked about that much before. We haven't had any guests who spoke to that before. I remember last year some fantastic projects came through. So we should dive into that sometime soon. It's definitely worthy of an episode, I think.

John McMullen 

So you've had all this experience in modular construction and you've started Modular Genius. Tell me more about your role as board chair, though, what are your responsibilities now with MBI?

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Developing the Next Generation of Modular Industry Workers w/ Modern Building Systems

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Alan Rasmussen, Vice President of Production at Oregon-based Modern Building Systems. Alan will be talking about workforce challenges in the industry, and what it takes to find and develop new modular industry workers.

John McMullen 

Alan, welcome.

Alan Rasmussen

Hey, thank you, John. It's a pleasure to be here.

John McMullen

Always good to talk to you. So, we've known each other for a while now, but for those who haven't met you, or have only met you briefly, I know your family, rather, has been in the industry for a long time. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

Alan Rasmussen

Yeah, so Modern, we just celebrated our 50th anniversary last week. So, we're proud of that to be in this industry for 50 years. There's been a lot of people that come in and out of the industry, but we take a lot of pride in being a solid rock in this industry. My grandfather started the company, and he was in fact one of two 2022 modular Hall of Fame recipients. So, we're very proud of him and his legacy and we look forward to carrying that on.

I represent the third generation of Modern Building Systems along with my cousin who served as our CFO. Our goals and visions are for a fourth generation. So that's what drives us here every day. We're located out headquartered out in a small town called Aumsville, Oregon. The only two commercial modular manufacturers in the state of Oregon are both located in a small town. Blazers just right across town, and we see each other at the US sporting events, the grocery store and the restaurants. It's a fun little dynamic for sure.

John McMullen

Oh, it's very cool. That’s very cool. So, you've been in and around the building industry for a long time now. I was wondering if you could speak to any of the trends that you've seen in the past several years. How has the industry changed?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, a lot out here is the energy code here on the west coast, the energy code is very progressive, and constantly changing. It kind of feels like the state of Washington, Oregon, and California all try to outdo themselves on the code. So, we've been scrambling quite a bit and reacting to that for the new energy codes. So, it's kind of unique when I serve on the Board of MBI and when I get to meet with our colleagues at board meetings and whatnot. Some of the things I tell them about what we do here in the energy code codes, they're kind of blown away by. So that's been a big one, the Green Building Movement has pushed the energy code quite a bit. It's been really directed at stick build buildings, but that slowed down to your mobile office trailer.

It's kind of crazy, some of the things that we have to do to a mobile office trailer out here, such as control receptacles, censored lighting, motion sensor, lighting, and the bard units. I think Bard has to build a special unit just to get through the energy code out here. So, that's been a big one. For the topic at hand today, I mean, workforce has been tough. The recession really took a lot of people out of the construction industry, trying to get over the stigma of a job in the construction industry. Then, this last recent history of COVID, it took a lot of people out of the workforce. Stay at home to be safe or stay home to take care of their kids who were not in school anymore. We're just now seeing that kind of pre up again, more applications coming in and that's been good. We cross our fingers as this next variant comes through that it doesn't slide back. So, those are some of the some of the trends I've seen.

John McMullen

How has Modern itself been affected by the workforce challenges?

Alan Rasmussen

Well out here like I mentioned, Blazers is right across town, so you have two modular factories in a small town competing for labor. We also have lumber mills and plywood mills within 15 miles that are very labor intensive, competing. So that's been tough. There are some jokes between HR folks that we look at resumes, and it's like, oh, they've been here, here, and here, they just kind of circle around in our small Canyon area that we are located in, it's really hurt. I mean, there's times you want to crank up that factory and kind of get going and you can't do it. You need some hands on the line, and you just can't get them there. So, it's hurt a little bit to go at the speed that we'd like to go and serve our clients.

John McMullen

So, you alluded to this earlier with all the other employers in your area, but have you seen this as an issue for the modular construction industry only or is this a sort of broader industry issue?

Alan Rasmussen

No, it's definitely a broader industry. A lot of my friends are residential home builders, and they may necessarily not need a bunch of labor themselves, but their subs are drastically affected. Just getting, scheduling subs, the same kind of stick to a project is just the same as trying to crank up the factory speed. You just can't do it, because there's just not enough bodies and work hours in the day. I've seen a lot of what the National Home Builders Association, they're really pushing a campaign to bring more people into the trades. I really feel like that's a space that the Modular Building Institute could do. Our industry could do some things because I think we've got some really great advantages that we could compete against the stick-built world to bring really skilled labor into our industry.

John McMullen

Have you noticed one region in the country dealing with these shortages or is this more of a nationwide challenge?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, I'd say from my perspective, I think it's a nationwide issue. Like I mentioned, when I sit down at the board meetings, and we kind of share our war stories together. After the meeting, it's one of the questions I ask like, hey, how's labor going? If it's down in Texas, or the southeast or the northeast, Midwest, I get the same answers. It's just tough right now and we just need to get the labor participation rate way up in this country. Again, like I said, I think the modular industry has a great advantage to bring people into skilled trades.

John McMullen

What challenges is the industry facing to bring in and train workers? I guess not just modular, but the building industry in general. What challenges are they specifically facing?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, again, I think there's a stigma against the construction industry that it's lesser than or dirty, really demanding, and there's cooler jobs to be had out there. I think our industry specifically, people think, Oh, it's just the manufactured home plan. That's boring. It's repetitive. Not a lot of excitement there. That's not the case. I think especially these commercial modular manufacturers, we're building some great products. These projects are very interesting. There's a lot of opportunity there.

John McMullen

So, what's Modern done to bring in workers and really develop talent over the past few years?

Alan Rasmussen

Yeah, this is this has been a real passion project of mine. To be kind of honest, it started out as very selfish. I'm just going to flip over any stone I can to find labors, construction workers. Our local area Salem, Oregon, the State Capitol, which is about 10 miles away, it's comprised of about eight high schools, and a very generous donor, who's a developer in town, set up a career technical school and it's a great model. These kids, they get bussed across town into the school and instead of just one hour of shop class, these students spend two and a half days at this school. So, their English classes tie to their construction program. So, they could be doing submittals, it could be reading plans, it could be writing bids. Their math class is tied to what they're doing. It could be geometry of figuring out the yards needed to pour foundation or angles for the rafters on the roof. So, I kind of got invited to check it out, and have been involved for at least four or five years doing mentoring programs, doing job fairs there, hosting tours at our factory and frankly, recruiting these students. There's also a nonprofit subsidiary that builds a house every year. So, the students get bussed out and they spend about four hours every other day out at the house project, framing, roofing, siding, doing finish carpentry doing all the phases.

So, I've been involved in that board, too and we recruit those kids. There's a great dovetail from their classroom because they're in a big warehouse space as their classroom. That greatly resembles the modular factory. So, when they transfer when I do recruit them in, and they transfer they come to work for Modern. It feels like home to them, they've been in this class their junior and senior year and Modern looks and feels a lot like their classroom back at the career technical school. When the pandemic hit, my wife's a high school principal, and I kind of knew what was going on. Kids were just scrambling, schools were scrambling like crazy, just to put some curriculum together. Kids were kind of sitting at home twiddling their thumbs, and there were some that I had just done a mock, you know, they'll do these mock interviews, to help build these their professional skills and I would tell them, I'll come in and do it, but I'm going to interview for real, I'm going to offer them jobs, and they're totally fine with that. They love that.

I had talked to him maybe a few weeks before the pandemic first hit. Then it kind of dawned on me one day I go, man, some of these kids that I was planning to talk to, and have them come on board when they graduated, or when the summer hit, are probably just sitting at home. I called a couple of them. I'm like, hey, do you want to come to work and they're like, sure. They still had some online school responsibilities and we worked it out that some days, they didn't have any, and they could put in, you know, eight hours a day. Some days, they needed to be on their computer for a couple hours and do an online class. We just had them clock out and I basically set up my conference room as a classroom for them. They would clock out and then come in and sit down in the conference room and do their school, eat their lunch, then clock back out and clock back in.

We've kind of done that model going forward. A lot of them when they hit their senior year, they don't have a full five-day school week, so I have several students right now that go to school two days a week and they work for me three days a week. Some of them go to school three days a week and work for me two days a week. When the summer hits, they're full time. So, it's been great.

Early on, I would say my station leads, my framing supervisor, finish supervisor, they were very leery of it. All these high school kids and now they'll tell you they've done such a great job at this career technical school teaching them that they prefer them. They want them on their crews, they want them in their stations. I will tell people reach out to those programs. Across the nation, they're talking about career technical schools and construction is always one that's usually prevalent in those programs and to connect with them.

John McMullen

So, you mentioned earlier the stigma that some people have against construction in general and doing that hands on kind of work. What's the feedback been from these kids who have come to work for you, who are in the factory doing real work? What sort of feedback have you gotten from them?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, they're so eager. A lot of these kids have never had a job before and if they have, it's been pretty light, maybe bagging groceries or something. So, they're really eager. They chose to go into this career technical school program. So, they're very eager to put those skills to use and make money on it. A lot of their friends that maybe some of their friends who do have jobs, minimum wage, and they're getting $5, 7, 8, 9 more an hour than their friends.

So, they're very eager to come in, work and it's kind of funny, they'll tell me they like coming and working in the factory over going to the House Project, the stick-built project site that they have for part of their senior year project. I'm looking out the window right now and it's 38 degrees and raining. They much prefer to come into the factories. It's nice and dry and they prefer that work environment. I've kind of alluded to it a few times earlier in this conversation is I think that's where we need to as an industry, highlight those advantages to come in and work in those controlled environments in the construction period.

John McMullen

So, you have alluded to those several times and I was going to ask what are those advantages that modular has over the stick-built construction, traditional construction industry? What can modular offer workers that they can't?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, first off is just the working conditions. The winter might be cold, snowing, raining, depending on where you are in the country. The other thing is schedule predictability. I've had plumbers and electricians who I've been able to recruit in because they're out in their work van and driving here and there, they don't know where necessarily, where they'll be one day or the other. In some of these big urban markets, they get stuck in traffic for an hour after work trying to get back to the shop and get in their truck and go home.

So, the schedule predictability, being able to tell their family when they're going to be home, being able to volunteer their time to coach their son or daughter's sports team. They like that. They like having that predictability. I have a electrical apprentice who's newly married, she's looking to start a family soon. She worked a couple of years in the traditional stick-built world as an electrical apprentice and she didn't see a path to be able to be a mother and do that career at the same time, just because of those factors that I talked about. She loves it here at Modern, she loves having a set, schedule predictability, and still be able to work in this and a very well paid a skilled trade labor job, and we're happy to support her in that. So that's awesome.

I think those are just some of the things that we need to as an industry and these companies in these industries, keep that in mind when you recruit these people. There are some great advantages.

John McMullen

So, based on what you're doing in the community, Modern, and what you've seen elsewhere, what ideas do you have that might help other manufacturers and builders bring in new workers?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, touching back on that career technical school. I would do these job fairs, or do these mock interviews, and with the work safety rules in this country you really can't have anyone under the age of 18 in your factory, swinging the hammer, using the nail gun or using the saws. It's like these students were eager to work, but I'd have to ask, hey, when are you going to turn 18? I could hire a few to clean and sweep up, but that's not going to set them on fire for the trades.

So, I started talking to a few of our contacts in the local Oregon legislature. They said, well, we can do an Oregon law, but it'll be superseded by federal law. I got talking to the Bureau of Labor and Industries here in the state of Oregon that has a child labor division, and it goes, hey, what you need to look at is this in the federal work safety law, there's something called a Student Learner program. We looked into that, and it's this collaborative between a school and the student is in some sort of CTE program. Maybe it's not as robust as what Salem Kaiser Public Schools is doing here in Oregon, but maybe it's just their one period shop class or whatever.

You have a document signed by the school, the guardian, parent, the student, the company, and they're an employee of mine, the work comp coverage is mine. By doing that, you can bring in students that are under the age of 18 and those restrictions on being in that setting, and what they call a hazardous work environment, you can be in that setting. You can use the tools.

So, I've been able to bring in labor that before wouldn't even cross your mind. They've been able to work in a collaborative with what they're doing in school and still meet the federal work safety laws. So that law, that path is out there. I encourage other modular companies to look at that and work with the local schools and those students.

John McMullen

Very cool. I learned something myself, so I'm glad we had this conversation. To the workers themselves, what's your pitch for working in modular construction?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, when I talk to people, talking to a perspective client, or even a client, what is this building we're building? One fun little phrase I use is, this is adult Lego building and we work fast. Their speed, it's changing every day. There are new and exciting projects, not every project is the same. So, one project to the other, we build those buildings a different way, it's a different set of Legos. As a child, you get bored playing with the same Lego set over and over. We get a great variety every day. Again, some of the advantages I've already mentioned, to just the schedule predictability, that work family life balance that can be achieved, and still work in construction. Much safer. In our factory, in most factories, roofing is by far more safer job tasks than it is out on a site-built construction project. We want you to come in and work and definitely go home to see your family. This industry is just safer. It's not as demanding and working in the environments. And it's fun.

John McMullen

So, it's almost at the at the end of this interview, before you go: Tell me what's going on at Modern. What's on the horizon for 2022?

Alan Rasmussen 

Well, we got some exciting stuff. I'm sitting here in our conference room chatting with you and I'm looking at a big set of plans in front of me, but a lot of swing space for schools. One I'm looking at the table here, it's going to be the school, it's a rural school district that needs to expand. They don't necessarily want a village of double wide classrooms. They can't quite afford stick-built construction, that's booming in costs. So, their five-classroom addition is going to be built with modular. So, we're going to tie it right into the existing school building. It's going to match the existing architecture. Those are the projects we get excited about. We're pretty heavy in the education industry and providing them solutions that don't necessarily have to be the double wide classrooms. They get pretty excited about that and have a few others like that per school district. So, I’m looking forward to it.

John McMullen

There's a great need for those education projects. My sons right now are in double-wide classrooms. Their school has gotten too big and they're doing that for the time-being until a new school can be built.

Alan Rasmussen

Yeah, that's the conversation we have with our school districts. There's something in between there, take a look at that and think long term solutions utilizing modular construction.

John McMullen

So, one last thing, I was hoping you could help me hype up MBI’s upcoming World of Modular in April. We're going to be back in person in San Antonio on April 25 through the 28th. I know you've been an attendee for a long time. Why do you and Modern keep coming back to World of Modular?

Alan Rasmussen

Well, I mean, this year, especially back in person, that should sell in itself. It's going to be big, it'd be nice to see everybody again. San Antonio, Texas in April will be nice and warm. Those from the northeast, up here in the northwest, and especially our Canadian members come and thaw out per se but it's always just a good time to catch up. We're a small niche industry, we're growing, but there's a great fraternity and it's always good to see the other people in your industry and learn from them, just chat with them, support each other. So, it's definitely worth the trip down and we really look forward to seeing everybody down there. As a board member, this is a this is a big piece of MBI’s budget every year. So help come support us so we can keep doing great things for you guys.

John McMullen

Well, thank you, Alan, I really appreciate you being here today. I learned some things and I'm looking forward to seeing you in April in San Antonio.

Alan Rasmussen

Alrighty, John, looking forward to it.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Inside the Fascinating World of Fire-Rated Assemblies for Modular Buildings w/ Banksia

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm talking with John Barrett, President at Banksia. John joins us today to talk about the state of current fire safety codes, and how to choose the best fire-rated assembly for a modular building. John, welcome.

John Barrot 

Yeah, thanks a lot.

John McMullen 

So tell me about yourself, John . How did you get your start in the industry? And how were you introduced to modular construction?

John Barrot 

So I was studying mechanical engineering at University of Sydney, in Australia. And I started interning for fire risk for some time, and then eventually started full time there for a couple of years. And then I moved over to New York in around 2006, where I've been for about 15 years now. And I work for a design firm called Arup, a global design firm. So it was there in around 2012, that I got involved in my first modular project, 461 Dean Street, which, you know, for folks that haven't heard of that project, it's a 32-story, volumetric modular project, located in Brooklyn.

John McMullen 

And so tell me about your role with Banksia. Now, what does Banksia focus on as a company?

John Barrot 

Yes, Banksia is a fire life safety consulting firm that provides consulting, performance-based fire engineering, fire protection, design and inspections.

John McMullen 

What's the landscape now for fire codes in the US? Is it state by state? Or their federal standards that you guys?

John Barrot 

Yeah, great question. So that there isn't a federal code that that governs all all buildings, that would be nice, it would be nice, that would be great. But for the time being, the the ICC produces model codes. So the International Building Code, etc. Those are then adopted by the states. And they do have variations from state to state. And those are for two reasons. One, each of the states might adopt a different version or edition of the code, it could be the 2018 or 2021. And then they make their own amendments to those those codes and standards, as well.  There are some exceptions to that. So for federal projects, you might have GSA Design Standards or Department of Defense standards that are federal, but they're usually an extra layer.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So the the ICC building codes and the fire safety codes are really one in the same?

John Barrot 

That's right. That's right. And the amendments could be that, you know, in states like Wyoming, there aren't any amendments to the model code. But in in a city like New York or state of California, the amendments are really substantive, and they vary substantially.

John McMullen 

So how often do the fire safety codes get updated? Is it any more often than the building codes themselves?

John Barrot 

They're similar. So it's usually a three-year cycle for the model code for ICC. And many states adopt on a similar cycle, some locations like New York City are on a [different] code, and so for like six years.

John McMullen 

So as the president of Banksia, and as a consulting firm, what challenges do you face when dealing with modular buildings? Are they different from traditionally-built buildings?

John Barrot 

Great question. So I mean, the end state with modular is always the same. You're trying to build a space that people love, and that's functional. And all those those things. It's really about, about the process, thinking about design in terms of manufacturing and assembly.  So how does that process influence your design? So for us, that means thinking about the types of materials that you're using for fire rated assemblies. In modular construction. It's about thinking of which aspects of the fire rated assemblies are being constructed in the factory versus which elements are being done on site and finishing of those those assemblies.  And then, I think lastly, things came through some things that you don't need to think about for traditional construction, which is, how do you take care of those materials during transportation and storage on site?

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So tell me about the fire-rated assemblies themselves. What options are manufacturers and builders typically working with when they're constructing a modular building?

John Barrot 

Yeah, so it certainly varies. And each modular manufacturer has different preferences. And also, it varies by their their process. So they may have different priorities and what they're doing. By and large, though, most manufacturers are trying to avoid wet trades. So things like spray applied cementitious coatings, or factory applied intumescent paints, because they have they have to dry and they have to cure and sometimes they require additional coats have to achieve their fire resistance. So what we typically see are fairly common materials like gift panels or gypsum boards, cement boards for floor systems. And you know, those are the primary ones. But we're also see innovations in the marketplace, though, folks like USG developing the STRUCTO-CRETE® product, which is very tailored to modular; we see other manufacturers that have started to think about products that could be more modular friendly. So it continues to evolve.

John McMullen 

Awesome, so and this may be of interest to some of our members who deal with buildings and container buildings: What can you tell me about the differences between the fire-rated assemblies for modular and for container-based buildings? Are they are that different?

John Barrot 

Yeah, the many of the concepts are similar. But it still comes back to how the structure performs. And shipping container based structures do have a slightly different way in which they perform structurally and thinking about that. So you're thinking about the container itself, it has a corrugated metal panel on all six sides. And you need to be thinking about how to maintain continuity of the floor system, the FIFO, the floor system and the walls themselves, which is a slightly different challenge to volumetric modular, you're still thinking about continuity of the floor system of continuity of the walls, but the underlying structures is different.

John McMullen 

So whether it's whether it's modular or container, how do you go about determining what kind of fire-rated assembly is right for a particular project? Is it based on the size or material or the layout of the building?

John Barrot 

Yeah, so that piece of it is, is very similar to conventional construction. So, how many stories? What's the height of the building? The use or occupancy of the building? Those are still the ways in which the building codes tell you what fire ratings you need.

John Barrot 

But ultimately, for modular construction, where it varies, I think, is where we start to think about what's the modular manufacturers process? How are we going to design the systems to be really suitable for that process, and where they're at in terms of their, their design and their purposes. And then I think some other things that are even more critical for modulus thinking about supply chain, both in terms of its reliability, not just the COVID, but free COVID. And the diversity of that supply chain. So there might be specific products that are that are really effective. But if there's only one supplier, it's a proprietary product. There's pros and cons to that. So if you want competitive pricing, think about alternatives.

John McMullen 

How about the units themselves, the prefabricated units,? An individual module of a building, for example. Does each unit need to be tested and inspected before installation? Or is testing only done when a building is complete?

John Barrot 

Great question. So if we're talking about inspections, there's kind of two aspects: there's thinking about the work that's done in the factory or in the manufacturing plant, and then the work that's done at the site. And so typically, for modular projects, you'll have a combination of both types of inspection. The portion of the work needs to be inspected in the factory where you still have MEP systems and structure exposed fireproofing as well fire stuff. And then when you're doing finish--worksite--work that work needs to be inspected as well at the site.

John McMullen 

I was wondering if you could describe how the inspections are done. I was preparing for this interview and it made me think...I used to work for a mattress manufacturer and I was thinking about the mattress burn test: they burn the top and they burn the side. And it's got to pass this very specific kind of test. What's the, what's the process for a building or a module? What are you looking at specifically? How does the building pass?

John Barrot 

Yeah, well, if we're talking about a special inspections and, and those kinds of things, it's really similar to conventional building so that you're, you're making sure that the constructed condition matches the the approved plans. So whether that be for fireproofing, or structure or plumbing or whatever, you know, and, and so I think that's, that's that is a bit.

John Barrot 

And then your example of sort of the mattress, I think you're also perhaps talking about fire-rated tests as well, or fire testing. And that piece of it gets really interesting for modular construction, because you do have to think about the connections between modules. And how to test those. There are procedures, necessarily the test for joints between modules, and joints between walls in quite the same way as conventional so there is a lot of thought given to how to do that for modular projects, and how to test those effectively.

John McMullen 

Is there a project that you've worked on that sticks out in your mind as being particularly challenging or complex? And what were you able to learn from that experience?

John Barrot 

Yeah, I think most modular practitioners would say their first module project was where they learnt a lot. And I think that's the same for me. 461 Dean Street was a really, you know, an amazing project. But a lot of challenges. The devil is certainly in the details, and thinking about lessons learned, you're thinking about, you know, the design and thinking about variations that you might have, to various system, various wall assemblies or floors, for different conditions in the building, thinking about how to deal with tolerances in the field, how to make adjustments there. And we did a tremendous amount of fire testing on that project. And thinking about how you can design those five tests, whether it be instruments like thermocouples, or just the way in which you test it so that you could use that data for future optimization that you might do for that project or another project.

So there was really a lot there on that one, but I think other projects that that I've, I've learned a great deal on as well. I did some work on Citizen M in New York, which was an 18-story project; different structural system, that one of the key differences was the modular manufacturers based in Poland for that project. So we had to think about the supply- chain aspect of it thinking through not just the fire- rated  assemblies, but also each of the different components that might be getting sourced from a different country or different location. And they might need to meet component-level tests. So fire-spread rating, or combustibility, and things like that. So it really added a different layer of complexity. And we continue to learn on every project that we did.

John McMullen 

How do you conduct those tests? Well, you just mentioned, you know, taking an individual component, is that done in a in a laboratory somewhere? Is that done? In a some sort of facility that you guys have? Or is it you work with other people? How does that work?

John Barrot 

We typically help modular manufacturers figure out what tests they need to do. And the best way to do that. We don't conduct the tests ourselves, we typically work with...for a couple of different vendors that might be able to do that for them there. There are many in the US and elsewhere. The test standards are a specific procedure. It's very prescriptive in terms of what they need to do. So, for combustibility tests, there's a certain apparatus that needs to test for that. And it has Pass/Fail criteria, and so on.

Where it becomes more complex is when you're dealing with assemblies, I mentioned earlier floor assembly or joints between floor assemblies. That's where there's a lot of potential customization and thought that we put in to help manufacturers set those tests up. And we'll work together with them and the test facility to get the right setup.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So if I'm a builder, I'm a manufacturer, when am I calling you? Am I calling you when I'm designing the building? Or do I have a building?

John Barrot 

Yeah, so we, we certainly advocate for being involved during research and development for module manufacturers. When there's a little less pressure on, you know, they're not on the clock. We certainly do get involved in projects or with clients for the first time on a project and that's fine. We just need to really work quickly and in an effective way to make sure they get this work done. And the reason why is because by testing takes time, these, these facilities have long lead times--really long lead times for some of the bigger ones like UL and at Intertek. And so you need planning you to figure out what the design is what we're going to test, you need to test it, and if it passes, great; if it doesn't, you need to do some optimization. And you have to factor that in.

John Barrot 

So with modular, one of the big selling points is the speed of construction. Right? And so if you're adding fire testing, and you're starting from zero, you know, at the beginning of a project that puts pressure on that schedule, so we are always advocating for getting involved before project status.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So if you're getting involved before a project starts, are you able to do any sort of testing at the, at the digital stage? If a company has a project and they've they've got it in BIM? Are you able to to look at that and and apply any sort of tests or look for any weaknesses there? Do you have to have something to test physically?

John Barrot 

Yeah, that's, that makes sense. Yeah. So we can do a couple of different things. So we can do basic kind of qualitative analysis, looking at other testing for those materials or assemblies that might have existing UL listings or so on and we could start to figure out, you know, what the likelihood of success is for a given component or assembly, we can also do calculations that can support that. So hand calculations. And depending on the material and the arrangement, we can also do fire modeling, which is looking at a transfer of elements, we typically don't need to do that early on, we can use some of those other methods I mentioned before fire testing, but on occasion, we can do that as well, if needed. Cool.

John McMullen 

What's the future of fire resistance and testing? You mentioned near the top of the interview, new materials the USG was coming out with? I was wondering if you could revisit that just for a second? What are those new materials or processes that we should be looking out for in the next few years?

John Barrot 

Yeah, I think what, what we've started to see is, is I gave a few of those examples where suppliers are starting to think more about modular construction and tailoring their products, I think that's going to that trend is going to continue, there are only a few that are really thinking about that.

We've had a couple of examples where there's really more of a co-development between suppliers of fire-stop systems of fire-rated products and modular manufacturers. So they're working together to develop a product that works for that manufacturer. So I think that'll continue.  I also think, to my point around R&D, I think that more and more module manufacturers are going to be including their fire-rated R&D development in their "secret sauce". So that's really, you know, traditionally you hear them talk about structural connections and things of that nature being part of their "secret sauce" so it's I think the fire-rated assemblies are more and more going to be part of that.

The other couple of things I think, is mass timber, there's an increasing interest in volumetric and modular mass timber, we haven't really seen that in the US market yet. And then also how decarbonization as that starts to enter the, you know, the development of these products. How that changes, how these different components will be developed, is going to introduce a new wave of testing that needs to take place. So lots to come?

John McMullen 

Very cool. What's something you wish your clients knew about fire safety and fire protection plans?

John Barrot 

So, I kind of touched on the the R&D piece. That's really critical, is really thinking about this for projects.

The other thing I probably want to cover: Architects are typically responsible for documenting the code compliance, including life safety, and things like fire-rated walls and the like. And fire protection engineering is really a specialist area. So we're always trying to advocate for someone like Banksia, to be involved in these projects to help deal with that architects have a lot on their plate. And this is just one, one piece of their responsibility. So we can really help to get projects on the right track in this regard, particularly for modular.

John McMullen 

That makes sense. That makes sense. So we're almost done. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention that you will be joining us at our World of Modular conference in April. You'll be presenting there. Tell me about your World of Modular presentation. What will attendees learn and what are you excited to share?

John Barrot 

Thanks, John. It's my third year at World of Modular, so I'm really really looking forward to it again, it's a great event. And so my the title of my presentation is Fire-Rated Assemblies for Modular Construction. It will cover some of the things that we've talked about today with a real emphasis on carefully considering fire-rated assemblies in modular construction and the differences that are in modular construction, in more detail that we've covered today, some of the key challenges. I'll cover some of the lessons learned from some of the projects I've mentioned, and some some more recent projects we've been involved with. And then some of the best practices that we've also learned on this project.

So we presented in the past that World of Modular, and I find that we get new questions and folks that haven't heard this before. And so just tried to beat the drum.

John McMullen 

Well, hopefully we can send a few people your way. If  you're listening, and this has been at all interesting, please find John at World of Modular I'm sure he has much more to say. Thanks, John. I really appreciate you taking some time out of your day for me, and I look forward to seeing you in April at World of Modular.

John Barrot 

Thanks, John. Thanks so much.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.From the Container Up: Using Shipping Containers to Create Industrial Buildings w/ Corner Cast Construction

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Rene Bernaert owner and Chief Operating Officer at Corner Cast Construction. Rene is going to talk about the ins and outs of container-based buildings and their potential for industrial use. Rene welcome.

Rene Bernaert 

Yeah, thanks for having me.

John McMullen 

My pleasure. So tell me about yourself, Rene. How did you get your start in the industry and what led to you going into modular and offsite construction?

Rene Bernaert 

Well, the first time I was introduced to the concept of offset construction must have been at the University. And I believe there was an assignment for a multi-story, parking garage with prefab concrete elements. And then when it was time to do my internship, I found the possibility to go to Italy and work at the HUD headquarters are one of the world's largest preset facade designer and manufacturer. And to be honest, my main motivation was to go to live in Italy, the combination of the combination of the off site manufacturing and the on site, installation really, really grabbed me.

John McMullen 

Awesome. And we've had an earlier conversation you said you went to school in Holland, is that right?

Rene Bernaert 

Yes. Correct. I did my master degrees in Holland.

John McMullen 

So you've been all over?

Rene Bernaert 

I have been traveling around, yeah. That's good.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. Um, when did you first become aware of the possibility of using shipping containers to create buildings? Were you excited about that at the start? Or did you kind of have to warm up to that idea?

Rene Bernaert 

Well, my first introduction must have been 10 years later, after my internship there I had moved to Canada, after finishing my master's in Holland, and after working as a production engineer in for the same Italian company in Montreal, I was actually looking for a new challenge. And when a friend of mine who works in logistics, he told me he was looking for an apartment and he visited a new building that was built out of containers. But well, he wasn't inside. Although he has been working in logistics all his life. He said he couldn't tell he was in a container.

So that that was interesting, but then he also told me that that that company or building was actually looking for hire people. And that actually interested in even more. So long story short, I was hired as a project manager there and I was put in charge of the 63-container workers accommodation built in northern Nunavut.

John McMullen 

Well that was a lucky break!

So, container buildings have been gaining a lot of momentum over the past several years. And I've seen a variety of really creative homes and retail spaces. We get a lot of them in our Awards of Distinction entries every year. Based on your experience a Corner Cast, why do you think containers have become so popular in the industrial building sector?

Rene Bernaert 

Very good question. Yes. So yeah, you're seeing residential and retail is very popular, and it's, it's obviously more visible than the industrial sector. But we mainly serve the industrial sector and yes, we are noticing an increase. And I think it's mainly due to the fact that containers are more and more accepted as a way of building. So just like my friend who didn't realize he was in a shipping container, we still get often the same reaction today. So when a client has that reaction, they they are hooked.

John McMullen 

And you bring up a good point. I brought up residential retail spaces, which are often the sort of the cover stories for container buildings, but But you guys corner cast specializes more on industrial buildings. So when you say industrial just so everyone listening is clear. What does that mean? An industrial building made out of containers?

Rene Bernaert 

So one of our main product is our maintenance garage. That's where we use where we use the shipping containers as a base for a lightweight structure. So we use the shipping containers as offices, locker rooms, compressor rooms, new rooms, everything is prefab pre built within the containers, then we place them and we build a structure between the containers, creating a large open space for truck maintenance, or...

John McMullen 

Okay, got it. So I was wondering if you could speak to the quality control aspect of building with containers? Because I don't know much about this. How are they inspected? Initially when when corner cast first takes possession of them? How do you inspect them? And and what criteria are there for using them in industrial projects? I guess the simple question is: Are all containers built the same? Can you use them in the same ways?

Rene Bernaert 

Largely Yes, so So are they build the same. Shipping Containers are all built using the same standards ISO guidelines that dictates strength, building material, paint spec, etc. But there are there are slight differences between different mates. So the containers are made in different factories and different factories do have slight differences such as the shape of the bottom rail changes, which seems insignificant, but for us within our design, we need to know that.

So when a container comes in, there's three or four items that we check right away, because we know that they have an influence on our design. Yeah, all the differences are between different types of containers. So you have 20 foot containers, or 40 foot containers, then, for example, and they have particular features, for example, 40 foot high cube has a gooseneck, which is a different structure within a floor.

53-foot containers are actually eight feet six wide, where actually the rest are eight feet wide. So there's there's differences.

John McMullen 

So with all these different shapes and sizes and ways of construction, are there challenges that you've encountered? When starting out on an industrial container building? Are there specific design or construction requirements that are trickier than others?

Rene Bernaert 

That's a very interesting question. I think, well, let's go back to start when we started Corner Cast, we were very much focused on existing prefab market sectors. But we had a very hard time competing with existing solutions. So we started more to focus on the type of project where functionality is more important than aesthetics. There's something to say, for containers using containers.

But we were facing the fact that most of these type of buildings were not considered to be built as prefab, let alone with containers. So for a long time, we found ourselves redesigning complete complexes and structures, to able to use shipping and things and is often involve a good understanding and rearranging complete processes because we change layouts. Oh, we were really introducing a new way of building in this sector. And it was hard to break that mold.

Until we did several successful projects, where today we see our concept being used as a solution. And we're often even asked to help design, sometimes as early as in a feasibility. That's that's that's where that's the difference. I think it's a more more generally accepted concept.

John McMullen 

Another question that that I don't know the answer to and I'm curious about are there jurisdictional or code restrictions that you've had to navigate when building with containers? Given that they are these prefab elements that you're bringing in from from other sources?

Rene Bernaert 

Well, I think everybody has enough. I mean, every general contractor needs to respect local building codes, whether you're building a shipping container or in wood, but answering your question that was so into reading building codes, while using shipping containers does get a little trickier, mainly because these guidelines are built are made around wood structures, not necessarily steel containers. So yes, that does take some, that does take some creativity sometimes. But we were never stopped using shipping containers due to crustaceans.

John McMullen 

What's the what's the biggest advantage to building with containers?

Rene Bernaert 

Yeah, that's that's a question I get a lot. And I don't think there's one particular advantage. I think it's, I think that there are several aspects that that all have influence on the choice of using shipping containers for project.

Portability is one, availability, speed of production, structural integrity, etc. Those are I think what it comes down to is, is to use these aspects in to your advantage as much as possible when you're designing or executing your project.

John McMullen 

Have you guys been affected by supply chain challenges at all with getting containers? Is that become more of an issue? Or is that not a factor?

Rene Bernaert 

Um, so far, convenience suppliers hasn't been the bottleneck.

John McMullen 

Okay.

Rene Bernaert 

It's more on our elements such as fans.

John McMullen

Got it.

Rene Bernaert 

There's all elements that will be put to use and have been...

John McMullen 

That you're putting into the containers that you...

Rene Bernaert 

Yeah, exactly.

John McMullen 

Gotcha.

Rene Bernaert 

So, electrical components are hard to get.

John McMullen 

What advice would you give to designers or builders who are tackling their first container project?

Rene Bernaert 

I think there's two major items. First, you need a good design. Sounds straightforward. But you need a good design that deals with certain elements of the container, such as weather proofing and thermal bridging.

Then once once you've got a good design, use a general contractor that knows containers. Don't just go into a container yard and ask them to cut some containers open for you. Use a general contractor because this is key for success.

John McMullen 

Are there is there a particular element of containers that requires that a detailed knowledge you were mentioning before about the different shapes of beams and the floors? And things like that? Are there very specific things that people will need to watch out for when using a container for the first time?

Rene Bernaert 

Well, those small details only become important when you have built on a larger scale. I see. Okay, you can it's not that difficult to  navigate those elements when you're just building a one off.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. Okay. Different kind of question for you. What's the future of container buildings? Do you foresee containers primarily being used for industrial use, like Corner Cast does? Or is it going to you think it'll go more towards residential or retail? Or is the sky the limit?

Rene Bernaert 

Well, I do think there's a limit for the use of containers because they're cool. Okay. I mean, once more people start building or using them because they're cool, then they're not cool anymore. Makes sense. So it's "cool factor" will decrease the effect, but that'll mainly affect residential and retail, I think. But I do believe containers are being widely accepted now. And when use for the right projects, they are there to stay as an alternative.

John McMullen 

Okay, so tell me about your World of Modular presentation. You're going to be presenting in April. We'll be in San Antonio, so I was wondering if you could tell me about that presentation. And specifically, what will attendees learn and what are you excited to share?

Rene Bernaert 

Yes, I'm very excited about this. And so yes, I will be talking the same subjects. So I'll be sharing my my experience with designing and building and so the title will be "Shipping Containers Go Where Wood and Steel Frames Don't...But Where Do They Go?" And the subtitle would be, "When Are Shipping Containers the Right Solutions?" And I've already mentioned this some aspects earlier in this interview that I will be diving into and explaining how how views container features in your advantage when you're using containers for a construction project.

John McMullen 

Very cool. I think containers are fascinating. So I can't wait. I appreciate your time today, Rene. I really do. And I look forward to seeing you in April at World of Modular.

Rene Bernaert 

Thank you very much.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Curtis Wong, founder and CEO of Cloud Apartments. Curtis will be talking about his fresh take on modular-based housing and the innovative ideas that are making it a reality.

Curtis, welcome.

Curtis Wong

Hi, John, great to be here.

John McMullen 

Tell me about yourself. Curtis, what's what's your background? And how did you find yourself in the modular construction industry?

Curtis Wong

Sure, sure. So my I've been somewhat obsessed with modular construction, I'd say, for the last five years or so. So quick background on myself. I graduated from Stanford University with a Master's in structural engineering about 10 years ago. So I've worked in the industry in California and on buildings from Los Angeles to San Francisco, that's get my PE license.

After that I did pivot, though, so in search for innovation, honestly, I went to SpaceX to work on LaunchPad. So I got to see a lot of cool stuff with the Falcon 9 vehicles. I got to see the first landing when we landed it back in the launch pad, and really learned a lot about innovation, and got me excited about engineering again.

So let's see, after SpaceX, I did go to Harvard to get my MBA, and spent those two years really thinking about what I wanted to do after graduating. Ultimately, I ended up going back into my original industry, the construction, and really thought about housing as something I want to tackle. So, I grew up in San Francisco, I've seen the damage that not enough housing does to a city. And I also see the rise of things like modular construction. So unlimited demand for housing, solution and modular made a lot of sense to pursue a business. And that is ultimately what is now Cloud Apartments.

So the last stop before departments was after graduating, I worked for this startup called StarCity. So StarCity raised over $50 million. And there I worked for a year on a tower called StarCity Minna. So it was a 16-story steel tower, and what would have been right in the middle of San Francisco, and I spent a year on that, as an engineer, as a developer, really got to see how you entitled something like that, how you make a tower like that in a seismic zone. So the engineering behind it had it had to build a modular tower and a strong unionized city like San Francisco. And we really got far on that project. I mean, unfortunately, also, it didn't get built, didn't have to do with modular however. But it made me so optimistic about modular construction as a solution to housing that I found investor. And I've been running with Cloud Apartments ever since.

John McMullen 

That's a pretty amazing background! Tell me about Cloud Apartments itself. It's a relatively new startup, right?

Curtis Wong

The idea is basically to start a new brand in multifamily rentals, using a product like a modular apartments. So thinking about it a bit differently. And the idea is to improve the quality for renters and really reduce costs for developers, we are really thinking about, consider how housing is built, and how it's evolving over time.

So, what I just described to you I'm calling 1.0: conventional construction. Building with studs, building with poured concrete; everything is customized, it's all one-off. And what we're moving into, I would say is 2.0: modular construction. That's what we're all familiar with. That is where it's built in a factory, getting some efficiencies in there and you're starting to shave down time to build housing. But still issues cost isn't saved in the way module construction is done today.

Where we're moving is 3.0: productized construction. That's what we're calling it. I see a lot of other players moving into this direction as well. So, for us productized construction is meant to reduce cost as well as time when you build and, for us, productized means we have three products: three apartments that we use for buildings. We’re calling it the Cloud S of studio apartments, the Cloud One, a one bedroom, and the Cloud Two, a two bedroom. And the characteristics of these are that they're as buildable as possible and as rentable as possible.

So, you know, just quickly when I mean that buildable meaning we have a patented connection system that allows him to really snap together on the jobsite, pipes, ducts, wires, as well as structure and really drive down cost and rental meaning we are spending the time to really do user research and make that amazing apartment as far as having all of the amenities, that fixings that you'd expect, you know, ample storage, large windows, all of those things, but also really starting to integrate and embed some smart features. If you think about the smart home today, you have 10 different IoT devices trying to talk to each other through 10 different apps. We're trying to make one cloud apartment app where renters actually get to enjoy some of these amazing Smart Home conveniences right when they move in.

John McMullen 

Well, it certainly sounds like you guys have thought of this from a ton of different angles. I love that you've really put yourself in the renter shoes, thinking about storage and amenities and IoT devices and all that.

You guys have been working with a lot of established MBI members, even though you're relatively new startup: Curtis Fletcher from Autovol, I think is advising you the guys at Architects Orange are helping with design. How did you go about assembling this team? And what influence have they had?

Curtis Wong

For sure, for sure. So a lot of the team came from my time at StarCity working on that tower, got to meet a lot of leaders in the modular industry, as well as go into all the modulars I went into 2020 conference, meet a lot of people. Yeah, it's a lot of people there to speak with. And I went. And the idea is to surround myself with the best and brightest I can have modular to all the leaders come from structural engineering architecture, to manufacturing, to contracting as many as I can and just learn everything. So, you know, Curtis Fletcher has been great. He’s working as an advisor to the company in his personal capacity. So, co-founder and CTO of Autovol there.

The other ones I brought in just some quick names like Bruce Greenfield, principal at Architects Orange, absolutely incredible. He's been a great help as we design this user experience. Troy Dean is another principal at PCI Structural Engineers, and working with Troy on his patented connection system. So, PCI has done, needless to say, a ton of work within the industry.

And just quickly, some other advisors I surrounded myself with include some module builders from RAD Urban. So RAD Urban really spearheaded a lot of innovation within steel, modular construction, especially in the bay area here. And you know, modular hotel chain Citizen M that uses a lot of modular for the hotels. So, it's really cool to have a team like that surrounding me.

John McMullen 

That's quite a team. That's quite a team. Kudos to you for finding those guys. And really surrounding yourself with a lot of talent. I think that potential is really unlimited there for sure.

You spoke a little bit earlier about the idea behind Cloud Apartments, what you're trying to do for the renters and the developers, I was wondering if you could go a little bit further. You made a comment about reducing the costs for developers. So how exactly is Cloud Apartments going to do that? What's your goal there?

Curtis Wong

Sure, sure. Yes. So, focusing on the developer, who I would say is our ultimate customer here. So I, you know, I mentioned I have perspective working in real estate development on housing projects. And, you know, my take on it is that developing housing is very, very difficult. I mean, that's, that's as simple as I could say, you're looking at sites, like a dozen sites, like I mentioned, you try to put some concepts together with your architects, you try to price it with a GC, that pricing is a little bit finger in the wind, because you're working off a concept. So, $100 a square foot, you know, it's a bit of a guess you don't really know what you're going to build yet. And then you have to put a pro forma together, right? With that cost. That's a bit of a guess. You do a market study to see if there's renters in the area that will make this a profitable endeavor.

So, you have to decide as a developer, if you want to put your own money in out of your own pocket to take down the land to get through entitlement, and hope that price and read those stick enough to get it capitalized on the other side. It's just very fuzzy and it's very risky, right? So, for us, we're seeing a little bit differently, like imagine where instead of doing that process I just mentioned, you start every business thing with this idea of building blocks that you start with that are pre designed, pre-approved, pre priced by contractors in factories, and prefabricated, right modular construction at these building blocks are used to really start. So, you have complete certainty immediately. Plus, you have cost savings that make those projects pencil.

So, this idea, greatly streamline and make that hold on process much, much easier. And the ultimate goal. And I guess, John, the last thing: I would say they're a little more philosophical about how I see the industry because, you know, I'm a bit, I'm a bit of someone that wants to work together with people. So I see that the industry is a bit combative. I think we're all familiar with this. A lot of players having liability that they're fighting over who's liable for what, it's a bit fighting over low margins in the industry, it's a tough industry, I see a future where we really put together these elite team of builders that have, you know, this, this branded type of a product that we're trying to build, that really creates these higher margins through innovation. And that can be shared, you know, between everyone, developers, builders, and even renters alike. So like, that's how I see the housing crisis ultimately be solved.

John McMullen 

Well, that's, that's very cool. That's very cool.

I want to switch gears just for a second, I was doing a little homework in preparation for this interview, and I was looking at your LinkedIn profile. And I saw a picture that you posted a couple of weeks ago, it's you sort of gazing into a big open warehouse space. I was worried if you could tell me about that space? And how big is it? And what pieces are you putting together there?

Curtis Wong

Sure, sure. So, the first thing we need to do so we're young company is to build a prototype. The prototype we're building is what I mentioned, it's the Cloud S (for the studio unit). It's the first one. And yeah, and that LinkedIn post, it's, it's the warehouse space we have it's in the Bay Area, I invite people to visit as much as they can. So please reach out to me and you can schedule a visit. It's a pretty small space. I think it's about 5000 square feet. And we're building that at Cloud.

So, I have one of my hires, Matthew Rapa, he was a superintendent at RAD Urban. Honestly, I would say he's one of the most—if not the most—experienced modular builders or installers in the country. He's installed over 1000 modules himself from not just the structure, but through full fit up. So, connecting pipes, caking, wires, doing finish work on the scenes of the modules, all of that. So I'm fortunate to have Matthew Rapa helping me build this prototype. And, yeah, within three or four months, we should have completely functioning prototype, that will be the product that we use for upcoming building.

John McMullen 

Well, that's awesome. I've been looking at your website, and the cloud has really all the models, but they're, they're fancy!

Curtis Wong

I appreciate that.

John McMullen 

I particularly like to bed that goes into the ceiling.

Curtis Wong

Right, right. So I just mentioned or living as a partner that's there. I can't take credit for that. But we're partnering with Ori Living. Definitely check them out, they have some of the coolest movable furniture you can imagine.

John McMullen 

So you're building a prototype, and you mentioned this before, earlier in the interview. Tell me about the connection system that you've created for these modules. How was it developed? How does it work? And why is it so important to your projects?

Curtis Wong

For sure. So, the connection system is this proprietary system that I mentioned, working on it with CCI structural engineers. And I guess I can start with a little secret within modular construction. And it's not so much of a secret. But the onsite portion of a modular build, you could say the onsite portion of an offsite is where cost savings are ultimately lost. It's just there's a lot of difficulty when you bring the boxes to the jobsite after they're stacked, you have to coordinate, you know, half a dozen different subcontractors to finish hooking up everything and finishing all that a lot of cost savings or law are lost on that process. And that has to do with boxes not being aligned that you can't easily install risers and things of that nature. And that is where we are zeroing in on.

So we really want to focus on that onsite portion. That is that if we can align everything with our patented system, we're key ailments or intolerance, and therefore we can really snap together those pipes and wires and ducts, like I mentioned on the job site. That's where we can really drive down the cost of construction and the time to build it. So not only do we have this patent system that we're working on, for us, we're actually you know, we're a product company with our apartments and we're installing our product.

So, Matthew Rapa. The guy I mentioned will be leading his own crew for our clients. I'm in buildings, these projects that we work on and doing the final install, I will fit out. Because our team will be trained. You know, starting with the clouds prototype I mentioned, trained, you know, imagine like a NASCAR pit crew, just everyone knows exactly what they're doing. extremely efficient. Plumbers are working next to electricians, that kind of thing. And extremely efficiently connecting these cloud departments together on the job site and really driving the cost. So that's ultimately how we want to be this real plug and play solution for modular. And again, the project's pencil.

John McMullen 

So tell me about the development of your flagship building, it's in San Jose, I believe. Where are you in that process? And what's coming up next?

Curtis Wong

Sure thing. So we've, we've used this site as a case study. So we've done a pretty full design of that site, and really priced it. So what we've seen is that even on project one 30% cost saving per housing unit, that's using the system that I just mentioned. And that makes it tensile really nicely. So we're still a little bit early. Again, we're a young company. But the prototype we're building that Cloud S is actually the exact unit in terms of structural design and everything that could be inserted into that fan as a project. Okay, so that's how far we're going with it. As far as next steps, you know, we're still early on, but it's a very feasible site, and we are looking for, you know, capital partners to speak with about it.

John McMullen 

And why did you choose San Jose?

Curtis Wong

Sure, sure. So, one background I didn't mention myself is that I worked for the mayor of San Jose one summer a few years back. But there I saw that Mayor Sam Liccardo is incredibly innovative and pro-development. He wants to build housing. His fantasy is one of these cities that is truly, I guess, you could say YIMBY (yes in my backyard) versus NIMBY. And yeah, they're inviting a lot of builders, a lot of a lot of innovative builders are going to San Jose.

John McMullen 

What challenges have you had to overcome so far on this project?

Curtis Wong

I mean, it's ultimately being a young company, that's going to be the challenge within this industry, like real estate is difficult. Our solution to that is ultimately, we are a partnership type of company. So I mentioned the architects who factories, GCS, you name it that we're partnering with. And we're not, I'll say this, we're not trying to be like the Katerra, where we just vertically integrate and where the GC and architect and everything is in house to “Trust us, even though we've never done this before. Trust us.” It's more like we have a cool new product that we're working on with some really established partners. So that's ultimately how we want to break into an industry like real estate, but also probably the biggest challenge outside.

John McMullen 

What's the what's the timeline for this project? I know you're just building your first prototype. But do you have a general sort of timeline? And if so what do you hope to learn while this whole prototype project is being built?

Curtis Wong

As far as the timeline, it's a little bit up in the air. But once we get investors involved, that's where we can really shine. Like I said, we're fully designed, in a way we have a product line of apartments Poway design, and we've used it for the San Jose site. So far as I'm concerned, it's ready for permit right now. And as far as construction, we could build this right now. Right? We're talking with builders already. So time was a little bit up in the air, but I'd say once you hit Go is where we can start to really show off how fast and as well as the quality that we can build housing with.

John McMullen 

So walk me through the development of a brand new cloud apartment building. If I'm, if I'm interested in building one in in LA or Portland or Seattle, or you know, any other city, how do I start? What's the process?

Curtis Wong

Yeah, so the way we start is typically, a developer or an owner would send us a site, it could be a site that they either already have secured, or it could be a site that they're looking at. And what we can do with our, our building blocks that we have this new approach that I mentioned, is we can put together basically a feasibility study, really early on with really high detail. We have partners in place, and we have these pre-designed apartments so we can tell you exactly how much it'll cost and what partners can build it. We can go further to and tell you how much a Cloud S, Cloud One, or a Cloud Two rents in that market you're looking at. So, basically assuring your revenue and your costs in your pro forma.

So, if that is up to the owner developers tastes that we move to next steps where we start to onboard ATC, you can say ACN with manufacturer team and really start going and we work somewhat as a partnership. So, we have preferred partners. We like that Understand, you know, these Cloud line of apartments. And we kind of form I like to call like a design build partnership, like we act like a design builder, because we're all building around this common building block. So, through this team, we can really accelerate through all the steps you need, through permitting, get your GMP in place and on to grandparents, and construction.

John McMullen 

Getting toward the end of the interview I wanted to ask before you go, though, and you mentioned this at the top, that you had gone to the 2020 world of modular and you'll be attending, sure, this year's World of Modular but as a speaker, I believe I'm really looking forward to meeting you there.

Can you tell us a little bit about your presentation and what you hope people will take away from it?

Curtis Wong

Sure, sure. So really looking forward from the 2020, being an attendee, and getting to see some of these really cool presentations to, you know, 2022, being able to present…that's really cool.

But as far as the presentation, there is one thing that I really want to challenge there is this idea that modular construction, in terms of costs, is on par with conventional, that the only thing you save on is time. I want to I want to push back against that, and really show that that, to me, is a complete fallacy. Like, the potential of modular is to save on cost as well as time. And that is why I'm so optimistic about this technology.

So, part of the presentation will focus on exactly how to do that. The other parts will be just, you know, reaching out. And I'll say this for the podcast as well. I mean, we're not vertically integrated. Like I mentioned, we're really pursuing a partnership approach. So, I really want to invite architects, engineers, contractors, developers in factures, all of these players to reach out to me, I think, I think there's a way we could build some housing together.

John McMullen 

That's great. And I, you said it before, I think World of Modular is probably your best place to really get introduced to these people. Everyone will be there. And I'm, I'm looking forward to dropping in on your session. I think it'll be a good one.

Curtis Wong

I really appreciate that job. I do.

John McMullen 

Thank you again, Curtis. I really appreciate your time today. And like I said, I look forward to seeing you in April.

Curtis Wong

It's been a pleasure, John, thank you so much. See you there.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside modular the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.Developing the Next Wave of Modular Residential Communities w/ Quartz Properties Management

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Joanna Schwartz, CEO of Quartz Properties Management. Joanna is here to talk about her company's development of modular-based residential communities around the country.

Joanna, welcome.

Joanna Schwartz

Hi, John. Nice to be here. Thanks for having me.

John McMullen 

It's my absolute pleasure. Thank you. So, tell me about yourself. What's your background and how were you introduced to modular construction?

Joanna Schwartz

Well, it's a little bit of a circuitous story. And the short answer is, in about 30 years of working, I've spent about 20 of those years in various forms of real estate, mostly on the finance side. TI was in the mortgage business for many years, I've dabbled a little bit in the equity crowdfunding world, but I was never developer and I was never doing the project. And about five years ago, I moved up to Boston and I said, “Well, I'm going to change that.” Because I'm always every couple of weeks analyzing a deal. I always jealous of the people actually on the ground, doing the deal, making the project building neighborhoods, changing communities. And so I decided that I wanted to be a developer.

I started doing a few projects with a few different groups of folks up here in the Boston area. And they were fine. They went well, but nothing really stuck. And subsequently, I decided to partner up with an old mentor and boss of mine, David Quint, who is now partner, you know, primary partner at Quartz Properties. That's how we got our fundamental name, Quartz: Quinn and Schwartz is Quartz Properties. Its a little secret.

Anyway, we decided that we wanted to do something interesting in the real estate sector together. But what we weren't exactly sure what. Separately, I was doing a renovation on my house up here. And we were struggling to find people to do the work and couldn't get a good deal. And all these amazing houses being built in my neighborhood, and they were going up like one after the other super quickly. And they were gorgeous. So, I reached out to the guy who was building them. I asked, “What is this? What are you doing?” And he was the one who told me, “Oh, these are modular houses. And I can build you a brand-new house in eight months, start to finish.” Now, that wasn't what we needed to do. So we didn't do it. But I was completely enamored right from then.

We started researching the potential of modular and as you know, you know, it is still a very underused form of construction United States. Only 2-3% of single family homes are done through modular, which is crazy to me as it's, as we know, more efficient, more green, more cost effective, it works better for the labor market. There are so many benefits to it. And so, we just decided today what we are going to figure out how to make modular a bigger component of the single-family housing market, we're going to try to do our small part to address the chronic housing shortage in the country. And we're going to use modular as a primary tool to help us do that, and so Quartz properties was born.

We were originally called Builders Partner in the first year or two, because initially, we're not builders—well we are now but we weren’t then—so we thought, “Well, let's go find builders and give them the financial strength and capacity to build more and to focus on modules and grow their own businesses.” We found out a lot of resistance in the market for people they didn't want to transition to modular, they didn't understand modular. And finally about a year and a half into our effort we said, “Okay, we're going to really decide and not only are we going to become developers, but we're actually going to be builders, we're going to go in and buy land, build communities and see how we can take this.

That was in 2018 and then we were off to the races. We bought our first development, which is called Padgett Place in Black Mountain, North Carolina. And we have just been on an incredible ride, growing and expanding,

John McMullen 

It sounds like. It sounds like it. Those are some very ambitious goals that you touched on. I was wondering if you could dive into that a little bit more. And tell me about your how you're working with builders and forming those relationships and really making it possible to achieve everything you want to achieve?

Joanna Schwartz

Well, so our goal, we are to the best of our knowledge, the only modular-centric home builder, that is a, you know, seeks to become a top 100 home builder in the United States—which is defined, I know the last time I looked at the list, it's kind of like 1100 units per year. So, we're nowhere close to that. But we fully expect to achieve that, you know, sometime in the next several years.

And so yeah, we do have very lofty goals. We are now building communities that are for sale, and we target our sales prices to be at kind of the midpoint of the range for prices in a certain market. We are now also starting to do projects that are what are called “build for rent.” So, they are purpose-built communities. Same process as building a community for sale: we buy raw land, we develop the land. But then when we build the houses instead of selling them, we rent. And that is becoming a very large segment, an important segment in the housing market. And so, we're doing projects that fit both of those business models right now.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. So, when you're buying the land you're planning in designing these communities. How do you go about that? Are these planned unit developments? Are they something different?

Joanna Schwartz

So, we have a library now of home designs that we are very comfortable with. They are they range, you know, inside from about 1300 square feet to 2300-2400 square feet. We have branches, we have some case. We're now finalizing our first townhomes. And when we go in, you know what we're doing smaller communities, smaller sized communities, typically, we're not competing with the large tract builders, we are not doing anything custom.

So, we go and we have a few floor plans, we have a few exterior designs, and we have a few interior packages, we make all the decisions ourselves. And one of the kind of mantras is like it's like attainable luxury. So, everything we have all the features that somebody would really want. In a beautiful home, we have the countertops, and the appliances that the beautiful showers and all of that, but no one has to pay extra for it and all just included in our base price. And, you know, we tend, because modular has to be built on a foundation, it can't be built on a crawlspace. We already know we're paying more for foundation. So, we actually look for projects, that while it's nice when the land is flat in the areas where we are, they tend not to be and then that just gives us a little bit more flexibility. And again, we're not competing with attract builders. So, you know, some units have basements and garages, some have a walkout in the back, they all usually have a big deck so that each house can be a little bit different in each neighborhood. And it really is dependent on the topography of where we are.

John McMullen 

Besides the land itself, is there any other criteria that you look at when choosing where to build?

Joanna Schwartz

Well, we have really fallen in love with a few areas and communities in particular western North Carolina. And our model down there is that we are now starting to vertically integrate our business. So we were a construction company. We're a general contractor in North Carolina. We are about to actually build out our own transportation capabilities for actually hauling and setting the modulars. And we have found that the more resources you actually have on the ground that you fully control, the better the outcomes are.

So, we originally started out saying oh, we're going to go everywhere really quickly. And we have retreated from that because we really see the benefit in going deep in a market and really getting a lot of capability. So that's what we're doing in western North Carolina. In Colorado, we have an excellent partner in a company called feeding West. They are our factory and our general contractor. And we are almost finished with phase one of a four Phase project with them. And we're very, very pleased with how that's going.

John McMullen 

And then you guys are in…?

Joanna Schwartz

So we have some land in Idaho that's still in pre-development. And we are working on finalizing the project team for that for, for those, those lots as we speak. And, you know, every time you go into a new place, you have to kind of start there is a lot of starting from scratch. So while we are excited about expanding into new markets, we're also excited about going deeper into the market that we have, there's so much opportunity and where we already are operating, that we're planning to go a little bit deeper in those markets as well.

John McMullen 

That's very exciting!

I want to loop back…You mentioned your first project a few minutes ago, it was called Padgett Place. I was wondering if you could tell us the genesis of that, and what lessons have you been able to learn from there and apply to your other projects?

Joanna Schwartz

Okay, sure, I've had to say it was, honestly such a great first project for us. And we've learned a tremendous amount. And I have taken all of those lessons with us everywhere we've gone.

So, number one, the way we got that project actually was a lead from a modular factory, who knew that we were looking for our first project, and they called us and said, Listen, we know the person who owns this land, they are struggling to actually turn it into a finance project. And maybe you can jump in and help them. And that was the genesis of how we got involved with that project. And it happened very, very quickly.

I think one of the thing that was very interesting from the beginning is that we realized that while yes, modular has its own advantages, and being, you know, faster and more efficient…once you get them to the site, it doesn't, it still doesn't change all of the other components that need to go into creating a development from scratch, meaning all the planning, the engineering, and the actual just land development, right, like clearing the land, building the roads, putting the utilities and that in for us on this project was really the long pole in the Tech because we were particularly inexperienced in that area. And it was a very steep learning curve for a bunch of, you know, honestly, pencil never been on the ground floor. It was a pretty steep learning curve for us, but we got through it. And fortunately, we had some good, you know, third party to put an exit plan in place, and we just had to implement it. And that's that development is has been incredibly successful for us.

We were able to, you know, once we dove into the modular piece, we were able to create our, the beginning of our design library, and of our finished packages. And a lot of the features that have met that now we're really known for. And the people who live in our community are extremely happy, they love their homes, they love their community, you know, it's only going to be 43 homes. So they're very tight knit group, smallish, smallish lots there. They're very friendly. They socialize all the time. And it's definitely very satisfying to kind of go through there and see that this was once just a field and now it is a thriving community and happy people living in a beautiful location.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. That's awesome.

I have a follow up question. You mentioned a learning curve a second ago, and I have to imagine there are several one of them I'm really curious about is how your manufacturing capabilities have changed since you started. You described yourself as a pencil pusher, but I'm sure you're more than that. But going from, you know, an office setting to manufacturing houses is a big leap. You mentioned Fading West was a partner of yours. How has that evolved?

Joanna Schwartz

Yeah, so we actually do not own our own factories. Everything else, all of the houses are manufactured by third parties. Fading West is the only partner that we have that manufactures and actually also serves as the general contractor. On the East Coast, we are the contractor for our projects and in North Carolina, we're the contractor for our projects and we get everything from factories. But there was a huge learning curve with that. And we have bought home from at least five different factories at this point, we have our favorites and we have forged very strong relationships with that factory and they are now supplying all of our homes for the two projects on the East Coast that are under construction right now.

So, there is a big learning curve, and the factories need to learn who you are and what you are. We're at a point now where we can tell them, you know, “we want an extended porch (Willow), elevation C, with a shell-finished package. And they know exactly what that means. And we’ll get the order approved pretty much immediately. So that's pretty powerful.

But to get to that point where you can order your house like you're ordering your dinner on DoorDash. You know, that is a pretty steep learning curve, not just for us, but also for the factories, because they don't typically work that way.

John McMullen 

So, all the manufacturers that you're working with, are working from a shared set of plans? You give each factory, you say, “I've got these three plans.” And that's what you've got? It's not three plans per manufacturer? It's three plans.

Joanna Schwartz

Yeah, I mean, you have to know that we have plans for our development. So, in the Fading West project, that those are actually plans from that camp that originated from their factories. So those are technically their plans. For the East Coast, we had plans for each of our developments and so we could switch factories and go to a different factory to produce those plans. But we're choosing not to. We've done a little bit of that, but we're now very happy.

John McMullen 

What factors do you consider when you're when you're designing and building these communities? Are there other trends or regional influences that you pay attention to?

Joanna Schwartz

Yeah, sure. Well, we, you know, we definitely keep track of lifestyle and what people are interested in and kind of the mega trends that everyone's following now with work from home. And you know, that term “digital nomads” in our communities in North Carolina, and in Colorado, you got a lot of people who have who are flocking into those areas, because they no longer have to be tethered to a desk somewhere in some city.

So, we definitely consider, you know, everyone loves a modern open floor plan. But at the end of the day, when you live in a house, you also kind of need private little spaces to be and to work and to, you know, do all the different activities and a family, you know, a family or a group of people we're all living together needs to be able to do. And so, we really consider that in our design.

For example, in a 1500 square foot home at Padgett Place, every single one of those homes also has a built-in work area desk, that's just you know, such a simple thing, right? But it's got drawers, it's got legs, it's got cabinets. And even though it's not in its own private office, it's a place where somebody can sit and work and actually do a job for all day. And that is not something that you would normally find built into a 1500 square foot moderately credit. So, we have things that we do things like that, because we really tried to get to their lifestyle, we were considering also kind of people's willingness to spend extra time and money on their home. So, we're trying to do things that are very low maintenance. Very beautiful, but high quality and low maintenance.

For example, we don't use wood floors in our homes, we use luxury vinyl plank floors, and they're gorgeous. They look just like wood, but they function much better. They don't scratch, they don't stain. They don't get ruined if a little bit of water, you know, get thrown on them, they can dry out. They're just incredibly durable. And they'll last for 25 years or something like that. Those are the types of things we think about when we're building the app. People really appreciate it.

John McMullen 

So walk me through the typical development of a new community. What's the first step? And how long does the process take from you deciding, you know, we want to build on this piece of land to having friends and neighbors moving?

Joanna Schwartz

Oh my god, it takes forever.

John McMullen 

[Laughing]

Joanna Schwartz

So, honestly, if I had to summarize my biggest frustration in the business is that, because what happens is we have a team of folks here who are very talented, and they go out and they find our land, they work with brokers, they work, they do all sorts of stuff. And we walk them, you know, to roll, they'll go walk in a real walk, and we'll put an offer, and we'll fall in love with people land. So real realistically, you know, it's at least a year or two before you can build anything. And if it's raw land, sometimes we're lucky, we can find lots that are finished, and then it's very quick.

But if it's raw land, and you have to go and get sites platted and approved, and then built out with infrastructure, that is a multiset is a two-year process. And there's not really a lot of ways to accelerate that, especially now, there are such backlogs at all of these bureaucratic boards in all of these counties that you know, combination of COVID staffing, you know, interests of so many people doing new projects, and the delays are actually staggering and very frustrating.

So, that’s just kind of par for the course. If you want to play in this market, you either have to do that or you have to be lucky enough and willing to pay enough for finished lots. Or, you know, developer who’s already done that process for you, and you combine to finish a lot. And there's a lot of that out there too. But you're gonna pay out for it a lot.

John McMullen 

You alluded to some of these: Have you found that there's any challenges that recur from project to project and they be approvals or waiting or, or does each project present sort of its own challenges? And I was wonder if you can give me an example.

Joanna Schwartz

I mean, there's obviously a lot of similarities, there's also a lot of us doing better, you know, as we become more experienced, or coming up the learning curve, there's certain traps that we don't fall into it more.

You know, I think, for us, because we don't have our own factory, making sure that for each project, we're selecting the optimal factory for that project. That's definitely something that, you know, we are, we're really focused on, and, you know, making sure that our budget is in place, and then it matches with where we're trying to finalize the transaction at the end of the day, whether it is for sale or for rent, you know, the, all the big titles of the challenges are the same for every project, but the details stick, depending on each project, right? Because something will come out of left field and you're like, oh, but you just, you know, you just kind of deal with it. And I'm a big believer in our company that I always like, you know, we're going to make mistakes, you cannot be afraid to move forward, you know, at the risk of making a mistake.

However, the challenge that I always present to all of us in our company is that let's only make the mistake once. And then let's learn from it systemize a way to avoid it. And, you know, that gives us room for that we find a different area that maybe we just don't make the same mistake twice. And so far, I don't really think we have which is which is encouraging.

John McMullen 

That is encouraging. I'll make a mistake at least three or four times before I learn from it.

Joanna Schwartz

[Laughing]

John McMullen 

So, have you run into any trouble with the supply chain or labor issues? You mentioned that before. How have you been navigating those

Joanna Schwartz

real instead of real challenge? You know, what, on the days where we get frustrated, and we're paying for delay, and we've had things for example, you know, the middle of COVID we had a house closing that got delayed I think it was three weeks because we were missing a particular bolts on the you know, bolts on the fan on the on the patio fans, and we couldn't get her feel because we didn't have enough. And it was just like, “Oh my God,” but we couldn't get the bolt. You know what I mean?

So, there are things like that, that you just are unavoidable and so minor and you just realize how many pieces go into the puzzle of finishing the house, whether it's modular or not. But I do feel better when we get frustrated when I hear really experienced people in the homebuilding industry have been in it for decades and they've built 1000s and 1000s of houses and they say they've never seen a more challenging time to be home building business. Which is a little bit counterintuitive, because if you're just a regular consumer in the market, you see the prices going up and it's an amazing time to be in this business. And certainly, it's fun when you see the prices come in on the contract. But to get to that point, it's unbelievably challenging.

So, the answer is a very big yes, we do have supply chain issues, we do have labor issues, we just aggressively manage them on a day-to-day basis. I mean, on the ground, we, we focus on being a very good employer, to our both our employees and to our subs, we pay very well, we practice what we preach, you know, we create a really nice work in a safe and nice work environment. And then we when we deal with the factories, the one good thing I can say is that because we're still very small, the factories have buying power that exceeds our own. And we've benefited from that.

So, on the East Coast, our factory is now you know, pre purchasing for us in advance, because we can very well predict what we need for the rest of the year and beyond. They are pre purchasing a lot of the hard to secure items for us and for our homes. So, it's not a perfect solution. But it is helping a lot and keeping us much closer to the schedule that we want to be on in terms of finishing.

John McMullen 

Yeah, good. So, what's next? Of course, you had mentioned doing some work in Idaho…What's coming up in the rest of the year and beyond?

Joanna Schwartz

Well, we're very excited because we own the land for what is going to become our first build-for-rent project. So, I mentioned that is a big piece of our strategy, we haven't built one of those yet. And so, we are really focusing on that sector of the market for to get our feet wet there. And we're pretty excited about the pipeline that we have in terms of expanding that side of our business. We're pretty excited about some of the vertical integration that we're doing on the East Coast. And we just want to we just want to do much, much more of exactly what we're doing. Because we finally feel like we've figured out how to do it.

John McMullen 

You’ve hit your stride!

Joanna Schwartz

Yeah, they call it the flywheel as they call it, trying to get that time to fly. We've been working for four years to get the flywheel moving, and it is finally moving. So that's very exciting.

John McMullen 

That is exciting. And I just want to thank you for your time. Today. Joanna, this is all very exciting. I look forward to keeping up with you guys. I really appreciate your making the time for me today.

Joanna Schwartz

Absolutely. Thanks for thank you and all you do for the industry. We appreciate it.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular, The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.How to Navigate the Complexities of Modular Construction and Ensure a Successful Project w/ Prefab Logic

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Curtis Fletcher, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Prefab Logic. Curtis is here to talk about the best ways to mitigate some of the complexities of modular construction, and the lessons he's learned from his years in the modular industry. Curtis, welcome.

Curtis Fletcher 

Thank you, John, really appreciate you having me on.

John McMullen 

It's my pleasure. Thank you. So, tell me about yourself, Curtis. You have a long history in modular construction. Can you give me a brief history of your career so far?

Curtis Fletcher 

Sure. Sure. I started straight out of school at Fleetwood Enterprise—actually down in their corporate offices in Riverside—manufactured industry doing RVs, travel trailers in the product development group. And from there I got into manufactured housing and then eventually spawned into my own business doing modular buildings, large scale modular buildings, out of a firm for about 10 years. And then I started Prefab Logic in 2015 with my partner, Rick Murdoch, after he departed from Guerdon Enterprises, and here we are today.

John McMullen 

Very good. So, what's kept you in the industry all these years? I know you've had Prefab Logic, and then lots of other projects…What keeps you going?

Curtis Fletcher 

You know, it's, it's the manufacturing side of it, and the product development side of the business that I really enjoy, you know, the creation component to the business that really gets me up in the morning. wasn't a problem solving.

John McMullen 

So, let's focus on Prefab Logic. You started that company in 2015, as you mentioned, with your partner, Rick Murdock, and you guys are modular consultants. Is that right? What does that what does that mean?

Curtis Fletcher 

Yeah, so we are, you know, we basically started the business with a premise in mind that we are bridging the gap between the manufacturing groups, the developer, and the general contractor, there always seems to be this disconnect between the groups and, and the large, unknown components to modular building, you know, on the developer and general contracting side of the business. And so that business is really spawned to create a synergy between the groups and provide all the information they need to actually get the project done efficiently, from drawings to data, etc.

John McMullen 

So, what's the process and when are you guys typically brought into a project?

Curtis Fletcher 

Typically, early in the process, you know, usually in the schematic design phase. Prefab Logic gets engaged in the project and helps steer the project. And nowadays, because the markets become so competitive, we're actually involved in the project, even in the entitlement phase; we'll do some early consulting to help make sure that the project is going to be able to be built in a modular fashion. So, you know, anywhere from that, that entitlement through setting phase will get involved and help drive the project forward.

John McMullen 

So, when you're coming in so early, what's your process for evaluating a project when you first become involved? I guess, whenever in the process you do become involved, what's that process look like? And what are you looking for?

Curtis Fletcher 

So, early in the process, our team will take a look at the project and determine whether it's going to be viable for modular in the first place. And then what that really means is, you know, one, does the site really even lend itself to getting modules onto the job site? Right? Are the power lines? Are there other parameters that are gonna keep that from happening or other transportation things? And then, you know, can we get the building to fit within the module? Or if it's down the road in design a bit and modules just don't really work and they don't have a lot of flexibility in the design. Then we'll sort of, you know, give that news to the developer and let them know early on.

Our job, in my view, is to get them the fastest answer. If it's going to be a “no,” we want that answer to come quickly so that they don't waste their time pursuing something that's not going to happen.

John McMullen 

What's the most complex aspect of a modular project? What do you what do you do to mitigate that complexity?

Curtis Fletcher 

You know, I would say, I mean, two things, right? The structural and the, the MEP systems, right: your mechanical, electrical, plumbing components, you know, tend to be some of the most difficult components and problematic areas in a modular project, because every module comes out completely finished on the inside to the highest extent possible, which means all those systems are in place. And you have to know that you can get those connections to happen vertically and horizontally in the field with the least interruption or, or impact the unit's interior, right.

And so, the most complex part of the project is getting that that stuff figured out ahead of time before the project hits the production line, and before it hits the site, so that everybody has a clear view of what that is going to entail when you get to the job site, and, and how difficult it's going to be or how easy it's going to be right.

John McMullen 

So in a nutshell, what's the value of having an outside management firm, like Prefab Logic, you know, as opposed to not having one at all?

Curtis Fletcher 

You know, we often refer to it as an insurance policy, right? It's one of those things that if you don't take the time to actually figure the project out completely and intricately the way we do, it's, it's very difficult to know, you know, for the factory to know how they're actually going to accomplish it. And for the onsite crew to know how they're going to accomplish it. If you don't figure out all the nuts and bolts because it is a manufacturing environment that this is being done in, if we don't figure all that stuff out ahead of time, then your result is going to be not so great. Right? You're not going to have the result you're looking for and you're going to be disappointed.

It really takes a group of people that understand the manufacturing process, and the on-site install and completion process to bring that together so that everybody feels the least amount of pain in doing this process all together.

John McMullen 

So what are some of the common missteps? And you alluded to some just now, but what is some of the common missteps that you've seen builders or designers or manufacturers make during a modular project? And what's your advice for how they can be avoided?

Curtis Fletcher 

You know, I mean, I think I think that probably the biggest misstep is not planning for modular in the first place. That's probably number one. Right. But other than that, I think it's just assuming that that somebody got it, right, somebody, somebody is going to take care of that. Right? Because, because often they don't, and it's nobody's I mean, it's just, it's just that it's not accounted for, it's no different than a scope of work for a contractor where you're, you're doing a scope of work to assure that everybody's got their piece of the puzzle covered, right, and that there's no gray and modular is the same way. And one of the big missteps people take it or make here is that they don't take the time to figure that out, and make sure that everything is covered, and that all those things are answered and getting the right team together in the first place.

John McMullen 

What's the what's the ideal timeline for a modular project?

Curtis Fletcher 

So, I want to return a question. So by timeline, what do you mean? Do you mean like, like, the length of time or do you mean…?

John McMullen 

Well, I guess every project is different, and you've got different factors to consider when you're talking about how long a project takes. But, um, let's see, I'll rephrase that: What's the ideal process for a modular project? Like what happens first, what happens second?

Curtis Fletcher 

Yeah. So, first thing is, you know, as I illustrated earlier, just a schematic design getting to that level. And then you know, from that point, what, what we like to do is we like to take that project then and then take over sort of the components ignited, be built in a factory and have those designed and developed so that all that factory stuff is figured out, start to finish. Now, that also includes the state submittal process and getting approved by the state, whatever state we're doing work in, and that process can be pretty lengthy depending on the timeliness of everybody on the team, and getting answers and deciding on specifications and all these different things that occur in a modular project.

You know, the ideal time, you know, to get like the length of time to get a project done to sort of illustrate that is, is anywhere from, you know, from a design stance anywhere from, you know, call it six months to nine months, depending on the team itself, right? We're actively trying to compress that through various means. We'd really like to see that at a four-month window for that design element to work better with finance and other components in the market.

John McMullen 

What advice do you have for traditional builders or designers who are considering modular? What do they what do they need to know before their first modular project?

Curtis Fletcher 

I think they need to know that there are different groups out there—Prefab Logic being one of them, but there are others, you know—that are very useful resources in the industry and MBI being one of them as well, right, that can help guide and shape their experience, you know, and in the modular pursuit. And reaching out to people that that have done it, and have a proven track record is really sort of paramount and your success.

John McMullen 

So, I've been asking a lot of “modular 101-type” of questions. So I'm going to throw a “modular 201” question at you: For teams who've already dipped their toes into modular construction—they’ve done a couple of projects—what lessons should they be trying to learn? And what process improvements should they be looking to make as they continue further down the line?

Curtis Fletcher 

You know, I think the I think the lessons that that any group should be learning is that, you know, first off, if you've done your first project, you've undoubtedly felt some pain, right? What you should know, and the lesson learned here is, you know, take that no different than site construction, take those lessons and apply them to the next project over time. And then and then develop your team, right? Over time, you will get to be like a machine in terms of producing, you know, the on-site completion process, and also the experience with the manufacturing, and pick a team and stay with it. Right. I mean, if you if you move from group to group to group, it gets very difficult to get, you know, a consistent outcome. If you can pick a team and ride that horse, and then refine your process, I think that's probably where you bring those lessons to bear on, you know, you know, throughout the, throughout the development timeline.

John McMullen 

We've had a lot of people speak to the value of, of teams and communication, but I think the way you put it, you know, sticking with that team, finding a team that works, sticking with them, and really just making sure that your wheels are greased and everything's working smoothly…I think it's great advice. So, thank you for that.

What are the next five to 10 years of modular construction look like? Where's the industry headed, do you think?

Curtis Fletcher 

Oh, well, you know, it's, it's, yeah…I've got a lot of forecasts for that. But it's, you know, I think it's gonna be very interesting. I mean, the market today is very, very up and down, right, in terms of supply chain and cost structures and so forth. But, you know, what we're seeing in the, in the marketplace is just this, this loss of skilled labor, right, which is been accelerated in a big way by the pandemic, leading people to retire early and find out that they you know, that they can retire, which is really led to this mass exodus of the industry, and leaving us with a lot of unskilled and untrained labor in the market, and just not enough of it in particular. And so when I look out five to 10 years from now, and the shortage of housing and the homelessness and you know, kind of unattainable housing in the marketplace, you know, I believe that manufacturing has to get better. You know, in terms of The number of units we can produce. And that can take various forms, I'm you know, I'm kohner, and very involved in a, in an automated manufacturing facility myself, and, you know, that is, in my view one of the big future components, because it's very tough to get labor right now. And it's the only way we're gonna actually offset that, that labor so that we can, you know, take the heavy lifting off the people and, and create an environment that people want to work in.

But we have to be able to produce more and as to get more automotive like, and to do that, it's going to take some big shifts in the market, in terms of what we find acceptable for housing, right, in terms of, you know, the size of the housing, the complexity of that housing. So, so we've got a lot of initiatives surrounding that in our various companies, but I see housing improving, I think, I think it will hit especially from the modular perspective, it will hit a new momentum over the next decade that that should be pretty unbelievable.

John McMullen 

Well, that's, that's exciting. And fingers crossed!

That's just about it for my questions, but I had one left: You are going to be at the upcoming World of Modular conference in April, and we were chatting before the podcast started, we're very excited to get back together, get the industry back together…I was wondering if you could touch on the presentation that you'll be doing there? And what are you excited to share? And what are you hoping people will learn from your session?

Curtis Fletcher 

Yeah, you know, yeah, that talk is really gonna sort of revolve around what we're doing and our processes here. prefab logic and what, what we've learned in those processes and how that is shaping the industry in terms of data and schedules, and, you know, the, the way we visualize projects, you know, using VR and AR and AR experience and production environments, but that and the paperless environments, you know, again, sort of leading to the same narrative of, you know, how do we get production to happen faster, right? It's not just about designing buildings, it's about how can we make buildings more manufacturable you know, at a better pace.

And so my talk is really going to revolve around that format that we've been using to help drive the industry forward. And, and hopefully sharing that message to other groups to do the same, right. We're all about helping lift, lift everybody's boat, right? And, and we need a lot of manufacturing in the marketplace and without, without sharing, you know, to other people, how we're doing it. And the experiences we've had and I've been at this for 39 years, myself, my partner's for I think 46 or 47 years. So, we've you know, we've seen a lot over our time, we're kind of at the at the tail end of our careers, we're hoping to get new folks into the marketplace, you know, younger people into the marketplace that want to pick up the mantle and carry it. And so my message is going to really revolve more around technology and the things we're doing and sort of the excitement that brings to the market, but should be a fantastic session.

John McMullen 

Curtis, I'm excited for it. Thank you for your time today. I really appreciate it. I know you're busy guy. I look forward to seeing you in April at the World of Modular.

Curtis Fletcher 

I thank you very much. Really appreciate it.

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.[Assistant]
Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Today's episode is also brought to you by the now virtual Off-Site Construction Expo, sponsored by the Modular Building Institute. There's no better opportunity to see focused presentations and exhibits from the off-site construction industry. Visit offsiteconstructionexpo.com today to register for one of their three upcoming virtual events. That's offsiteconstructionexpo.com.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I am the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Amanda Gattenbee, Vice President of Development at CRATE Modular in Southern California. Amanda is here to talk about container-based modular buildings and all of their many different applications. Amanda, welcome!

[Amanda]
Hi, John. Thanks for having me. Such a pleasure.

[John]
It is my pleasure. Thank you very much. So, let's dive right in. Tell me about CRATE Modular. How did it start?

[Amanda]
CRATE Modular acquired a predecessor company, and that predecessor company started in the education sector, replacing the old modulars that you see all over Southern California, specifically in LAUSD. It was a sustainable answer for these schools, and they had pretty good success with that. Then I came along in 2016, and the focus really shifted to housing.

[John]
Gotcha. Have you guys always been in Southern California?

[Amanda]
Yes, we started in a 10,000-square-foot metal building on the banks of the LA River, and we now have a 110,000-square-foot facility in Carson, California, in the Los Angeles metro at the 405 and 710 junctions.

[John]
That's quite a bit of growth. Congratulations.

[Amanda]
Thank you.

[John]
Why shipping containers? What's special about those?

[Amanda]
Our company is founded on sustainability. There are so many available containers. There's a trade deficit in the United States where we import way more containers than we export. Countries overseas would rather sell us a new container full of goods than pay to ship an empty one back. So, we have these steel boxes laying fallow, made to hold 65,000 pounds of material, rigorously tested and stackable. That just seemed like a really perfect building block.

[John]
I'm a big fan of container-based buildings myself. I think they're just cool to look at, if nothing else. How do you source these containers? Do you work with shipping yards or other providers?

[Amanda]
Yes, our factory is about 10 miles away from the Port of Long Beach and the Port of LA. We only source one-way dry goods containers—containers that have been used for one-way dry goods trade. Every container has a serial number, and as I mentioned, they're rigorously tested by several different agencies for seaworthiness and safety. So, our containers are definitely more inspected and tested than traditional building materials. We source the containers that have been used only for one-way dry goods, and every container has a serial number, so you can track its history.

[John]
That's fascinating. I had no idea that they were only 90 days old. That's awesome that you guys are able to reuse these containers. It's a shame that they can't be reused as part of trade. It seems like that would be the obvious thing to do, but I understand that it's cheaper not to.

[Amanda]
Some of them are diverted for storage containers on construction sites, but we're using 500 to 1,000 of them a year.

[John]
Wow, that's quite a number. So, tell me about the people in your company. I've heard a lot now about containers, but what about the people? What kind of trades are involved in bringing a container-based building to life?

[Amanda]
We are nothing without our people; they're our greatest asset. Our workforce includes welders, ironworkers, demo welders, metal stub framers, insulation experts (both spray foam and batt), licensed electricians, and a licensed plumber on staff. We also use vendors for fire sprinklers and roofing. All of our labor is in-house.

[John]
Approximately how many people do you have on staff?

[Amanda]
We have 75 people on the floor and 25 people on the office side.

[John]
What's the design process like for these buildings? Do you use BIM or other methods, and how has that evolved over time?

[Amanda]
Design is something very special because we have the state approval from HCD, like many other modular companies. So, we create our own set of drawings for the modular building only. We include the design of the foundation in that. We design the building in a vacuum, and then that's the set that gets state-approved. There's still a local submission and approval for the site-specific placement of our state-approved building on that lot. We design very quickly, usually within 90 to 120 days for the modular set. We get approvals anywhere from 48 hours to 10 days max. So, we have an expedited timeline for design. We use Revit and CAD for our design work.

[John]
Great. Now, speaking of foundations, are there any foundational requirements for container-based buildings as opposed to traditional buildings?

[Amanda]
We use a typical stem wall foundation, usually 18 to 30 inches. The reason we do that is we need that crawl space for under building utility connections. The stem wall usually has embedded hardware that the containers weld to. We can also go on a podium with a similar type of assembly.

[John]
And you touched on this before, but how long does it take, start to finish, to convert a shipping container into a habitable space? How fast is that turnaround?

[Amanda]
We can produce 15 modules a day, but it takes one module between 14 and 21 days to make its way down the assembly line. That includes taking a brand-new shipping container and turning it into livable or workable space.

[John]
That's right. You mentioned you have a factory where manufacturing meets construction. So, it takes 14 to 21 days to transform one container. That's fascinating. I hadn't realized the details of the process. Now, I know you've been involved in some exciting projects. Could you tell me about your Potter's Lane project? How did that come about, and what has the reception been?

[Amanda]
Potter's Lane is the first affordable housing project in the nation using shipping containers. It houses 16 formerly homeless veterans and provides access to social services. It's an unincorporated area of Orange County. It's a flagship project for us and the reception has been phenomenal. We were on the front page of the LA Times, and even though the project was four years ago, I heard mention of it on 60 Minutes a few months ago.

[John]
It's still getting recognition, which is fantastic. I think it's one of those projects that's really making an impact and changing perceptions. Now, you also have the Coldin Avenue project, which is a multi-family building. Tell me about that and how it's different from Potter's Lane.

[Amanda]
Coldin Avenue was the first multi-story container development in the city of Los Angeles, three stories tall. It's permanent supportive housing, and the developer used an interesting model where they leveraged crowdfunding and social impact equity to fund the building. They then master-lease it to a social service provider. The project serves formerly homeless individuals and families in the local area in South Valley.

[John]
That's impressive. Now, in more general terms, where do you think container-based modular construction fits in the overall construction landscape? Is it more suited for certain projects over others? What's the best use for containers?

[Amanda]
We can do containers for almost any type of project. If you can build it, you can build it with CRATE. We've had several different uses, but I would say that container modular is most useful in scenarios where time is a critical factor, and you need your project done very quickly. We recently had the opportunity to deploy a homeless shelter for the City of Buena Park. This was a 15,000-square-foot facility, and we designed not only the building but also the site, including civil and landscape, in just 60 days. We got approval in 48 hours. It was fabricated in four months, and the contractor took four months to finish it once it was delivered to the site. So, time seems to be the common denominator. We also excel in tight sites or projects where you want something very strong with great energy values and sound attenuation. Our thermal envelope makes our buildings virtually silent from unit to unit and floor to floor.

[John]
That's fascinating. I hadn't thought of sound attenuation as one of the benefits of container-based construction. What other projects have you recently completed or do you have any more in the pipeline?

[Amanda]
We recently completed the grand opening for the Buena Park Emergency Navigation Center, which was two weeks ago. We currently have another shelter in the factory that we're replicating for another jurisdiction. Once we design and engineer a building, and we have factory approval to build it, we can replicate it for different clients. We're also working on a five-story building in Los Angeles. Additionally, we have an opportunity zone project with 21 units of single-room occupancy (SRO) housing in San Diego.

[John]
That's impressive. When you mentioned a five-story building, is that your first four-story building?

[Amanda]
Yes, it's our first four-story building.

[John]
Are there height limitations when it comes to container-based construction? I think earlier in the conversation, you mentioned containers could be stacked 10 high for shipping purposes. Could you potentially build a 10-story building?

[Amanda]
As of now, we are approved to go up to five stories. We've engineered up to five stories, which would be five stories over grade. To go higher, you would typically need to transition to Type I construction and tie into a concrete core. Currently, we're working within those limitations.

[John]
That's great to know. I had a couple more questions. You mentioned replicating a shelter for another jurisdiction. When you say "shelter," do you mean another development for homeless individuals?

[Amanda]
Yes, it's essentially the same shelter design, but for a different jurisdiction. We've leveraged our efficiencies and buying power to bring the project to the client at a slightly reduced cost since we've already done it once.

[John]
That's a great approach, especially when addressing the urgent need for shelters. Well, Amanda, I think that was all the questions I had. I really enjoyed this conversation, and I appreciate your time today. I'm looking forward to seeing your future projects.

[Amanda]

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!Continuing a Centuries-Long Tradition of Innovative Construction Materials w/ CertainTeed/Saint Gobain

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today, I'm talking with Brent Belanger and John Harding of CertainTeed/Saint Gobain. Brent and John are here to discuss the benefits of CertainTeed’s products and share details about several of their new products.

Brent and John, welcome.

Brent Belanger

John. Thank you.

John Harding

Hey, John.

John McMullen 

Tell me about yourself, Brent. What's your background? And how did you end up with CertainTeed?

Brent Belanger

Thank you for the question in this opportunity. First of all, John, I'm Brent Belanger, the Senior Technical Solutions Manager with CertainTeed Canada. I've actually been in the industry, the construction industry, working for several manufacturers across Canada for the past 35 plus years, 16 of which have been with CertainTeed. And I've had a number of roles with CertainTeed. I’m currently on the Senior Technical Solutions Manager and part of that scope model, part of my scope of duties rather, is overseeing our off site presence in Canada.

John McMullen 

Very good. And John, tell me about yourself, what's your background?

John Harding

Great, great. So, I'm the business lead for offsite construction in the US. And kind of a different background than Brent. I've been in the building and construction industry for roughly 15 years, different systems and manufacturing software and in different types of roles, strategy, marketing, business development. I've been with CertainTeed/Saint Gobain for roughly two and a half years, part of the CertainTeed platforms team, which supports the CertainTeed businesses based out of outside of Boston.

So, one of the things we really focus on is, you know, the solutions we can offer the offsite segment and modular now and further, what kind of problems are there and the offsite segment that we can really dig into and understand and help develop solutions to?

John McMullen 

Very good. It sounds like you guys combined have a ton of experience. That's awesome.

Brent, I was wondering if you could tell me more about CertainTeed itself. What kind of products do you guys provide? And how do they benefit the modular and offsite industries?

Brent Belanger

Certainly, John. Well, let's start first by stating that CertainTeed is a part of the single band Corporation and Saint Gobain is a large global manufacturer of a variety of construction and building materials and high-performance products. And they've been around since the 60s, as in 1665. They have, yes, over 350 years of experience, in fact, interesting anecdote is that one of the very first projects that single band supplied was the hall of mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. So, we may have listeners who've been there and have looked at that glass work. That was a Saint Gobain project, one of the very first ones. But here in North America, we're our division is known as CertainTeed. We, we have a variety of product lines, including chips and finishing products, ceilings, products and suspension systems, insulation for thermal applications and acoustical applications, and also roofing, shingles, and siding and siding, trims as well and accessories. And certainly, we're getting involved with the photovoltaic side of it when it comes to roofing. So, a lot of interesting products and solutions that we've developed and introduced over the years.

John McMullen 

That's quite a range and quite a quite a history. That's, that's amazing. I'm not sure what to say to that!

So, John, I know that you guys will be at MBI’s World of Modular this year, and that this is your first time exhibiting is that right?

John Harding

Yes.

John McMullen 

So, what made you decide to come this year?

John Harding

Hey, you know, we're still looking at it from a crawl, walk run process. And, you know, we're still kind of crawling walking a little bit and learning this industry and making sure we're asking the right questions. So, in 2020, I actually missed the event when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. I was actually scheduled to attend, but I did not attend.

John McMullen 

We barely made it out of that one!

John Harding

Exactly right. So, I did go to the virtual one the year after, so last year, but it wasn't an exhibit, it was mainly as an attendee, I learned a heck of a lot did a lot of great networking. And, you know, Brent and I were talking and trying to develop our plan for this year. And, you know, we'll be there representing certainties Autobahn this year. I think a couple of things, you know, number one, we want to share the solutions with the industry, we've got a lot of interesting products and systems that factories can, you know, become more efficient, become save time, etc, in the manufacturing process that we want to share with them. But also the educational opportunities, a lot of great educational classes that are happening. And the networking is really something we're really excited about as well.

John McMullen 

That's great. 2020 was my first World of Modular. I'm really looking forward to this one. The networking is just awesome. I think you'll come away very pleased.

But you mentioned new products are there are there specific products that you’re bringing to World of Modular that you can tell me a little bit about?

John Harding

Sure. I'll address a couple of them here, John. The first one is something called STONEfacade. It's a great system for low-rise commercial building applications, but also on the residential side. Think of a panelized stone facade. We've got a new plant in Quakerstown, Pennsylvania, that opened up recently, and they're shipping product now, basically, from the east of the Mississippi to north of Virginia.

So, it's a panelized stone facade system, it has an integrated rain screen, no mortars needed, it's easy to install. And then the aesthetics are great. They look fabulous. A lot of factories have shown interest. And again, we're just trying to get the word out and explain to them some of the benefits of, of that product.

The other one I'll touch on is a system called NO COAT PRO. And it's, you know, ready to install corners with joint compound cut to any length. It's one of the pain points in the industry in terms of the cycle time and the drywall process of the mudding taping, drying, etc.

So, probably five months ago…Just a real quick little story about five months ago: We did a demo at Factory_OS, and the demo went so great, they said, “Hey, let us hold on to that unit” so they can continue using it in their factory and until they actually place their orders. And again, it's about improving the efficiency and saving time in their factory and again, we've had a lot of conversations with different factories, many others have purchased the system and again, it's about improving efficiency. So, those are two unique products.

John McMullen 

Well, if you don't mind a quick question. I'm not very familiar I'll be honest about either type of products. So, the façade—of course I know what that is—but is this a factory-installed facade, or is that something that's done onsite?

John Harding

So, we're positioning as both on the onsite absolutely use it. But we're doing there's a few trials that are happening right now and those are done in-factory and you know, you don't need a mason and you don't need to wait for someone to come in to actually do it. You can have your guy get trained up pretty quickly. And that person could be the, you know, the stone facade person in the factory. So yeah, it's very flexible in that sense.

John McMullen 

And the NO COAT PRO would be the same thing: factory and onsite? Or is that more geared towards one or the other?

John Harding

It is a both onsite and offsite. And what I've seen in the factory is they're using it…It was interesting to watch the Factory_OS team use it. So, it the actual corners are mudded, the tape has already muddied then they program in the length of where the call on the corners should be. So, they grab it off the roller and they start throwing it up on those corners. And it happens real quick. So, they see a lot of benefit and using that type of product again to improve efficiency.

John McMullen 

Very, very cool. Are there other products Brent that maybe you could tell me about?

Brent Belanger

Yes, John. First one I'll tell you about is our GlasRoc products. This is a weather-resistant gypsum sheeting and it uses glass mat technology. Traditional gypsum sheeting really doesn't stand up well to the exposure to the elements, for instance. And this is a product that has a one-year warranty. So, if in fact is left exposed through whatever conditions—be its slope, snow, sleet, rain, high heat, etc—it’s going to be able to withstand all those elements. It's a technology that's been around for quite a while we are we are producing it in a number of our facilities across North America, though. So, it helps in terms of logistics, especially when we're talking about modular Ross like construction.

The fact that it has a one-year exposure warranty is ideal if there are delays for whatever reason with projects. And current market is a very good example that there are a lot of shortages occurring right now in labor materials or just logistical issues. So, so it's something that I think, to go back to John's point about pain points and solutions, it answers that solution that we have for logistics, for example. And this is a technology that can be used for not only sheathing, you know, we have tile backer as well. And there are other applications that can be used for as well. Yeah, very ideal product for offsite. And we do a lot with panelized manufacturers right now.

And the other product, I'd like to mention this MemBrain. So, this is a smart vapor retarder. And the reason this product is becoming so important is because of the way building codes and construction methods are changing, especially in the northern part in the Central States. In the US, and also across Canada, we have energy codes that are becoming more demanding requiring higher R-values and thermal values in the walls. So that's incorporating things like insulated sheathings, which are not…some of them may not be very permeable. So, that makes readability of your walls a little more challenging.

And also we're having building codes that are demanding more air tightness. Once again, your buildings are becoming tighter. And we're seeing passive designs and netzero energy types of designs going out. So, they're ideal, they're great, especially with the environmental solutions we're trying to look for in the industry. But with traditional vapor retarders, they're ideal when it's cold when you're in near those heating conditions. However, in the summer months, your vapor drive is very different, you have warm air on the outside, and it's humid, and that's being driven into your wall. And if you have a vapor retarder on the inside of your wall that's impermeable—which most of them are, obviously—that increases the risk of moisture accumulating in your wall cavity. And that can affect thermal performance of your insulation in the cavity. If it's extreme enough, you have a situation where that moisture can accumulate and lead to things like rot, and mold, and perhaps rust if you're dealing with a metal structure.

So, the MemBrain is a smart vapor retarder. Because once that humidity level gets too high in the cavity, just by the nature of it—it’s a polymer in a nylon knit—it opens up, and it becomes semi permeable, and it allows that moisture to dissipate and migrate through the wall. So, it's peace of mind for not only the owner, but for the occupants as well build structures,

John McMullen 

These sound like fantastic products. Are all of these going to be available in your booth to either look at or hear about come World of Modular?

Brent Belanger

Absolutely. But go ahead.

John Harding

Yeah, no, I was gonna say we definitely will have some STONEfacade there. John, we've got a great video of NO COAT PRO. We'll have some great brochures and literature when it comes to MemBrain and GlasRoc as well. So yeah.

John McMullen 

Excellent! Well, stock up, I could see the interest level being high. It's gonna be a busy show. So what's on what's on the horizon for CertainTeed? Is there anything exciting in development that you can tell me about?

John Harding

Yeah.

John McMullen 

So, what's on what's on the horizon for CertainTeed? Is there anything exciting in development that you can tell me about?

Brent Belanger

Well, I mean, we are a very innovative company. We have an R&D center—several R&D centers—across North America, and certainly even more across the globe. And innovation has always been one of our backbones. In fact, one in five products that we've introduced did not exist five years ago. So yeah, we're definitely on the on the trail of innovating and providing new solutions for customers.

So, our hope here is to really listen to customers that come by our booth, see what they're looking for in terms of solutions and hopefully trying to tailor our product lines to meet their needs.

John McMullen 

Excellent, excellent. That's the questions I have. Is there anything you wish to leave our listeners with? Something that they can look forward to seeing or hearing at World of Modular that you haven't already talked about?

John Harding

I think it's just a matter of having conversations and learning from them on hopefully they can they can take away a few ideas from us in terms of some solutions. And that may help them in their challenges, John.

Brent Belanger

Yeah. And if I can just say, John, I mean, we have a lot of products and solutions. We won't have them all there. But certainly, they can certainly check out our website, certainteed.com, and be ready to ask any questions. We'll be there ready to answer them.

John McMullen 

Very good. Very good. Well, thank you, John. Thank you, Brett. I really appreciate your time today. I look forward to meeting both of you at the end of April at the World of modular in San Antonio.

John Harding

Excellent. We'll see you there, John.

Brent Belanger

My pleasure. Thank you, John.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside modular, the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.How Automation Can Fulfill the Potential of Modular Construction w/ Autovol

John McMullen

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Rick Murdock, co-founder and CEO of Autovol. Rick is here to talk about the formation of Autovol and about the potential for automation to revolutionize the modular construction industry.

Rick, welcome.

Rick Murdock

How are you doing, John?

John McMullen

I am very well. Thank you very much.

So, tell me about yourself. Rick, you've been in modular construction for a long time now. And you've got a slew of successful companies. How'd you get started?

Rick Murdock

You know, I got started 45 years ago as a young man into the mobile home or manufactured housing business in West Texas, and I just really loved it and enjoyed the manufacturing, I enjoyed seeing what you could build. And then most of all, I enjoyed all the people in the company and everyone that you could meet and work with, it was just a real pleasurable experience.

So I kind of grew from there. I just stayed in the industry. I've been in it all my life, I went through several different companies, I was fortunate enough to receive my first manufacturing plant at a very early age, I think I was 26. And into a plant in the south, which was a challenge but also a great, a great challenge at that.

The plant turned out to be very successful. I kind of went from there to other manufacturers and ran different companies and then finally ended up in Boise, Idaho in 1989.

I was given a call from a recruiter and asked if I would be interested in coming up and trying to work with a company to get out of bankruptcy. I thought that would be an amazing experience. And something that would look good on a resume. And so I also took that opportunity. And fortunate enough, we were successful in turning that company around. And then, you know, it was probably 10 years, maybe 12 years later ended up going in partners and buying that company. And from that company, we transformed into the first multi-story, multifamily modular builder in the Western United States, and started building multifamily multistory for modular construction.

I sold the company in 2015, along with my partners, and started Prefab Logic, which is really on the other side of the spectrum of our industry. It was more of the engineering services company that worked with architects, structural engineers, general contractors, and so forth on that side of the business, really helping them to understand the modular experience, being able to take products that they would want to build and, and modularize those and, and model those out so they can be built out of a manufacturing plant and delivered. That was very successful. We did the drawing packages and so forth those companies and really took off with Prefab Logic and grew that company.

And I was entertained by an email inviting me to a automation event in Omaha, Nebraska. At that time, I was out of manufacturing and loving what I was doing with Prefab, but really was interested in the automation piece. And so I flew up there and was quite amazed at what I was seeing in automation. And not that it was in a factory setting, but it was automation that I could see that would work in manufacturing. And so I left there fully energized to talk to people and was bound determined to go out and get back into manufacturing. But do it with a different twist this time and try to change how we did it.

And so we were able to put together and stake out of all which is the first fully automated robotic, modular manufacturing plant in the country.

John McMullen

Well, that's a that's an amazing story. Rick, I can I'm thinking back to when I was 26. I had no idea I wanted to do yet you were running companies.

So let's talk about Autovol. You started that company, like you said a few years ago. You guys are really focused on automation and modular construction. What made you want to dive into that? You said you were energized coming out of seeing that, that automation, but what was going through your head? What was your big idea?

Rick Murdock

I did come out of that amazed. And the reason why I was amazed is through all my years in the industry, and all the different wonderful plants that I've worked with and all the divisions that I had, in that in that time. One thing stayed common throughout all the manufacturing plants that I was involved with. And that was the work that the labor had to do and go through all plants, it's heavy lifting, it's stretching, it's bending, it's 8-10 hours a day. And I was really watching the toll that was taken on people because I had done that very thing myself.

And so the robotics and the automation was very cool. And I saw an opportunity to change the way we do construction and use that very cool robotics and automation, to take the heavy lifting off people and put it on machines, and freeing people up to use their minds and do more planning and just really sue people for the trades that I believe work for the human body. And, and that was all your trades, and that's electrical, plumbing and so forth.

So the automation gave us an opportunity to do the construction work, all the heavy lifting of building and framing and securing and gluing and sheathing and put that on robots.

John McMullen

So what can you tell me about the factory itself? I'm interested in really like what you had to learn, in order to build a factory for automated construction, it seems very complicated.

Rick Murdock

Well, it is complicated. And I can tell you, it was a whole different education after being in manual manufacturing plants all my life, because now we were working with robots and robots. And the automation was extremely cool. But it really quickly you understand that the robots are no different than a hammer or a saw or anything else, they do nothing until it's programmed to do so.

And so gathering that information, bringing in the people and collaborating with House of Design Robotics to successfully integrate all this was a brand new experience and one that I enjoyed and learned so much from because now we were operating the automation and the robotics and actually telling them the things that had to do. And so that was a new twist. Setting the plan up, getting all that organized, getting that integrated in so we could actually do all of our construction with automation took a lot of collaboration between our company, our previous company, Prefab Logic, who formed all the data, our integration company, simulating companies, all those things to bring this together. So it was a whole different animal to approach and really understanding the type of people that would have to come along in our industry to make that successful.

John McMullen

Wow, the hats off to you, sir. I'm in awe of people who can take technology and really apply it in new ways. I, I was proud of myself the other day, I reinstalled windows on my computer. I think that was my big accomplishment.

Rick Murdock

Ha! Good job!

John McMullen

I really I'm looking forward to watching you guys grow.

What are the inherent benefits of automation? You touched on some of the benefits for people, you're not having to do all the heavy lifting. But specifically, when it comes to modular construction, what are the benefits of automation?

Rick Murdock

Well, again, I will touch on the people because taking the heavy lifting off people and putting it on machines. But it also deals with precision. Because robots don't get tired, they don't care about the weight. So they're going to do the same thing over and over as a program to do. And they're only as good as your program to do. So once you program your robots to either fasten or to frame and so forth. He'll do it the same way every time until it's instructed to do it differently.

The other benefits was what we saw a little bit of but not near to the point of what we received. And that was the different education that had to come in to a manufacturing plant. People with degrees and in industrial engineering and electrical engineering and so forth software's writing programs, all those people suddenly became part of a manufacturing facility building modules. And they brought that education and those techniques with them to share with the rest of the group that would go out there and do the physical work and the trades.

And so it opened up the door to a different type of construction worker that was coming into a manufacturing plant to grow it to a new level. And then it also opened up the door for a lot more women in the workplace. You know, the average, the average company has anywhere from seven to 8% women working in their workplace we have 30% and we have that because it's so technical. Again, the heavy lifting is out of it. And so we found a valuable resource in the workforce to really bring into our company and help us expand.

John McMullen

That's great. That's great. I wanted to touch back on something you alluded to just a minute ago, when you said it was just programming, are there limits to what robots can do when it comes to building or really isn't all just a matter of program.

Rick Murdock

There are limits. I mean, there are projects out there that modular construction does not work for and automation is really, you can do it, it's not really meant to do that. To get the most efficiency out of automation, what you want to try to do is you want to do your best to standardize and to be able to build in a certain manner, similar to what they would do with a F-150, out of Ford Motor Company, they're building the same product over and over, and they're adding different qualities to the product to make the difference. And in amenities that you're going to see, modular manufacturing is best if you can standardize and make it very repetitive, because more repetitive is, the more efficient it is.

So that was a big help to us. And so we're building standardized products, and we can build buildings that look totally different from the next one, but have little changes in the actual construction.

John McMullen

So how about from an architects or engineers point of view? Do they have to approach these projects differently, given the automated nature of the construction?

Rick Murdock

They do, they have to approach it differently. First of all, because it's, it's modular, and it's done differently than what you would do in traditional, but also the automation. Because automation, you have to really design around its limitations. And so examples of that my friend would be, if you're building vaulted walls, or any things of that nature, that's not really a program that works very well for automation. It's more about Flat Top walls, at different heights, and so forth to give you everything you need is just didn't have the design. And so they need to understand the limitations of that and help design around it. And that's what prefab logic does. One of our companies is helps them understand what the capabilities are and what they're not.

John McMullen

So tell me about the process of teaching robots, how to build modules, what goes into that? And how long did that process take to figure out for Autovol?

Rick Murdock

Most of all, that is data. And that's getting the right data coming from engineering and come through the planning process. And then you take that data, and then you write scripts that really tell the robots what to do. And that process took a few months to get the right people in here with the right education that it really understood that and then to work with our collaborating partners, how to design robotics again, and the integration of that. And then our operators that have to manage and be able to send those signals off to the robots and the automation to make it work properly. So it was a few months and getting that under our belt and really understanding that and basically creating it.

John McMullen

So what's the biggest difference? In your view between modular construction and automated modular construction? What benefits have you seen so far?

Rick Murdock

Well, obviously, we've seen the benefit of the base that we got here for our employee base, and all of our solutioneers here. We have very little turnover here. We have our solution errs that are more concentrated on oversight, education, it's a lot easier work for them. Within that within that plant. It's bringing in a different education, which changes the culture of your company. And I think it betters it, and just building the culture of your company to where all people from different facets and different expertise can come in and form something that's never been done before that really makes a great impact on manufacturing.

John McMullen

I liked that answer. I also liked the words that you used: “solutioneers”, I think. Is that something you came up with?

Rick Murdock

You know, Autovol created that and actually, Merrick Macomber, my EA, she's one that came up with the word but the word was really created because as wonderful as the robots are and the automation is, and the creation of Autovol, what's most important are the people. We're still a people industry. And we're using automation and robotics as a tool to get the job done to make it easier for people and better for building. And so we don't refer to them as employees. We don't refer to him or workforce because we see them they're far more important to that they're the ones that are building our company and taking our company forward.

So our attention is on the people here growing the people helping them grow and allowing them to go in and do what they're best at in creating this automation and robotic technology and finishing out modules.

John McMullen

Well I liked that very much. So kudos to Merrick for coming up with “solutioneers.” I like that a lot.

Have you faced any challenges with automation? Anything unexpected?

Rick Murdock

So far, we've had so many unexpected things pop up at this that I don't even know if I could count them. And it seems that even though you've been in manufacturing all your lives, you haven't done it with automation robotics. And so there was anybody pick up the phone and say, Hey, what do I do now. So we're having to develop this and create this. And so there were plenty of surprises. limitations were surprises, some of the writings were surprises.

And then it's, it's, it's funny with automation, you can go in, and you can make a change to a piece of software, and it repairs the problem that you're having, but it may cause another one somewhere else. And so it's how finite that has to be and how much focus you have to put on it. But we were able to come through all those the plants up and operating well, we've got probably 70% of our automation working right now we're finishing off the final line that will take it automated.

So we've learned a lot. We've pioneered a lot and it's doing real well, x and I can tell you that for the guys that are out there manually building in front of this automation that's being developed. It's amazing to watch them when the automation is developed. And they're no longer doing the heavy lifting, and they're on to other things. So tell me about some of the projects you're working on now, what's coming out of your factory, where are these projects going? Well, our company is really focused on affordable housing. And so we are builders. And we're really what's come out of the factory since we started is five-story, multi-story multifamily.

Finally, affordable housing. So we're building apartment buildings. And so far everything that we've built has gone into the state of California, because the costs are so higher and the needs are great for housing. And so we've built, we just started our sixth project in California. And that'll be another five-story apartment building there.

So that's really what our concentration has been on. Are there certain types of buildings or projects that lend themselves better to automated construction, apartment buildings lends itself very well. Hotels lend themselves very well. Workforce Housing very well, student housing very well, all of those multi-story multifamily buildings where you're going to house quite a few people, we really have focused on the quarter type unit so that you'd have a quarter running down through the center of it. And you've got a living unit on either side, very much like you'd see in a hotel or a large apartment building. Those things lend themselves very well to modular manufacturing.

John McMullen

What have you learned about automation, now that everything is up, you're rolling, things are going relatively smoothly? What have you learned about automation, and I was wondering if maybe you think there's still potential for bigger and better and more efficiency?

Rick Murdock

Well, the first thing that I learned and we had to do is prove it. And we've proven it works. We've proven it work in our products, we've proven it worked in our manufacturing process, we've also proven it works in in obtaining volume, to be a high-volume plant. The other thing we learned is there's still lots of opportunity for automation. There's other areas in manufacturing, that automation can be adapted to, and really help out the cause, especially with all the labor shortages or our country's going through right now. It's lend itself to to help be helpful in that. So there's still a lot, a lot to be done with automation, a lot of progression that needs to happen.

John McMullen

You mentioned all these opportunities for automation, I can only assume that there will be more companies like Autovol popping up in the near future. Do you have any advice for the future Rick Murdock's of the world who are starting these automated construction companies?

Rick Murdock

I do. And the first one was, is really have a desire to be a risk taker, be able to collaborate with everyone because it takes it takes quite a few different types of companies to come in and really create this created with the mindset that you're designing the manufacturing plant for the product you want to build. And so that all the data that you're feeding in to create these plants, reflects exactly the products that you want to build. Those are the things I would do that and then patients, you have to have patience, because with automation, and especially with software's and so forth. There's always something that's jumping up in the way that you have to defeat. And so with patience, and just constant drive, you'll get it done and work very well for you.

John McMullen

Very good. Here's one of my favorite questions. What are the next five to 10 years look like for modular construction, I guess particularly automated modular construction and where are we headed?

Rick Murdock

Well, in my opinion, we've got a housing crisis that reaches all the way across our country. In fact, it reaches across the globe. And so I think that the future of manufacturing housing is going to look very much like the automobile business, right, we're going to be able to automate, we're going to be able to use robots in the building of this, we're going to be able to produce more with less, and we're gonna be able to grow our manufacturing facilities to really fight the need that we have for housing.

Right now what the demand is for housing far outreach is what we're capable of building. And I believe that our industry is going to move in a direction to where traditional construction and automated modular manufacturing, we're going to see that they need to be linked together, to better provide the numbers that are needed, and also the costs that are needed.

John McMullen

So last question, we are getting towards the end of April, which means world of modular is right around the corner, I know you'll be there. What can you tell me about your presentation? And world of modular? What do you think attendees will learn? And what are you excited to share?

Rick Murdock

Well, I'm going to be talking about the reason why we need automation, robotics and humans working together, and what that looks like what the future looks like, and why I believe it's necessity. And so that's really what the my discussion is going to be about and talking to the people and I'm hoping to share that information and get others interested.

John McMullen

Well, I really appreciate your time today, Rick, I know that you will be in San Antonio with all of us next week. So you probably got travel plans this weekend. So again, I appreciate your time. I'm excited for you and for Autovol, and I look forward to seeing you next week.

Rick Murdock

Thanks, John. Look forward to seeing you.

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with MBI executive director Tom Hardiman. Tom is here to discuss a critical issue facing the modular construction industry, and what we can all do to protect our collective interests.

Tom, thanks for being here.

Tom Hardiman 

John, thanks for having me on today.

John McMullen 

My pleasure. Before we start, we're just coming off World of Modular and I was wondering if you could give us a brief recap your recollections, your feelings of how that event went?

Tom Hardiman 

Oh, I think it was great. We had over 1000 attendees in San Antonio. And it's just so good to be back in person and reconnect with everyone. The energy was real high, you could just kind of sense a buzz in the air and excitement about our industry. So I was thrilled with how it went.

John McMullen 

Excellent. Excellent. I brought up World of Modular for a reason, actually. On Thursday, we had our business meeting, and leads us into the topic of this podcast. Actually, at that business meeting, you made some very important comments about the expansion of the Davis-Bacon act. And so I was wondering if you could sort of give us some background on that.

What is the Davis-Bacon act in a nutshell?

Tom Hardiman 

Well, sure. You know, about a week before we went to the conference, we learned that there was going to be an expansion or proposed expansion to the Davis-Bacon act. And just real brief summary: The Davis-Bacon Act is a 90-year-old law. In 1931 Congress passed the Davis-Bacon Act. And the intent is to set what they call prevailing wages for various construction trades, laborers, electricians, plumbers, etc. For any federally funded work. So if you're bidding on this work, you have to pay these prescribed prevailing wages for your tradespeople.

So that's the law as it exists, and it's been that way for 90 years.

John McMullen 

What effect has the Davis-Bacon Act historically had on offsite and modular construction and what's being proposed now?

Tom Hardiman 

Well, historically, it's very specific. the Davis-Bacon Act applies to construction on the site of work. That's always been the case. There have been numerous legal challenges that attempts to expand that definition to offsite fabrication, not just our industry, not as modular but everything from sheet metal, ductwork, fencing, all sorts of cases have been filed to prevent the expansion of Davis Bacon from applying off the side of work. The proposal that we're talking about, does just that it calls for prevailing wages to be applied back in our factories back in our modular factories, regardless of where those factories are located. So it creates numerous challenges, as you might imagine.

John McMullen 

So what are the what are some of the specific impacts that the Davis-Bacon expansion would have on offsite and modular?

Tom Hardiman 

Well, specifically, we'll start with this: it is a construction labor law. The way it's written, the trade classifications are construction specific laborers, carpenters, electricians, painters, drywall, installers, tile installers, so forth. The attempt is to try to pick up those on-site trades and apply them to factory workers, modular factory workers. And it's ill-fitting because the work that happens in the factories--the tasks, the activities, the skill set, the risk profile--is different than what happens on-site. So it the trade classifications just don't fit the workers in the factory. And there doesn't seem to be an understanding by the Department of Labor, or they just don't care, that they don't fit and it would just create an administrative nightmare for the factories to try to force those prescribed rates on their workers when they're going sometimes in different projects, different tasks, if you will.

So that's, that's kind of the first obstacle: it doesn't fit our industry. Backing up a little bit more specifically, we don't think the Department of Labor has the authority to expand the Davis-Bacon law without congressional oversight. This was not a law that was passed, there was no hearings. This is just the agency saying, we read it. And we we interpret it a little differently than everyone else has for the past 20-30 years. So we're now going to apply this to offsite, modular prefabrication shops. were opposed to that we're fighting against the trend to fit the traditional construction rates back in the factory. And then there's some other challenges with it as well. But you know, we can we can touch on.

John McMullen 

What is MBI doing? What response does the industry have?

Tom Hardiman 

I've been the director here for almost 20 years. And I think and I believe this is the biggest threat to our industry growth in my all my time I've been here...or maybe the biggest threat to industry growth ever.

We are looking at this, this is our line in the sand. This is our fight, and we're going to take it to the US Department of Labor, really a three-pronged approach is what we're looking at. There's an immediate response, there's a midterm, and then there's probably going to be a long term action required. In the immediate term, we need to submit public comments for this proposed rule, we have about a week left to do that. So that's happening, we, we hired a very powerful law firm in Washington, DC to help facilitate this. So we'll submit public comments, we don't think that's going to have a great deal of influence in changing the Department of Labor's mind. So we're prepared for the next steps, which includes getting some congressional reps involved, to help make our case force more of an advocacy campaign. And then ultimately, if this does pass and gets applied to our industry, we plan to challenge it in court.

So there, there's a regulatory response. There's a legislative advocacy piece, and then there's a judicial response that we're playing, we're going to utilize all three branches of government to fight this thing.

John McMullen 

What's your message to members who may be thinking, "Hey, I don't think this applies to me, I don't really do federal work." Is there any risk of this sort of trickling down to the state level?

Tom Hardiman 

Yeah, that is a huge concern. So the federal Davis-Bacon law...I realize not a lot of our members do federally-funded work, but it's more than you might think about. There are multifamily housing projects that are funded through HUD grants that are required to pay Davis Bacon rates, we haven't had to pay him in the past, we will have to pay them going forward. All of this new stimulus money that they're talking about spending, it's going to be wrapped up in Davis-Bacon rates, everything from installing solar panels, all the new spinning that's coming out of DC, it's going to trigger Davis-Bacon.

And even if that still doesn't concern you, there are 26 states that have what they call little Davis Bacon laws or state prevailing wage laws. And if the feds say, they've changed the rules on us and off site is now covered. You can bet California, New York, and Maryland and several other states are going to follow suit. And what that means now is this could impact state-funded projects. And education is our one of our biggest markets and our industry, housing, healthcare projects that are that utilize state funds.

So if you're doing anything for a federal- or state-funded agency, you're at risk. You're at risk of either saying "this is too complicated, I don't want to do it and I'm walking away" or trying to figure out how you're going to apply these construction rates back in your factory and it's a nightmare scenario, either way.

John McMullen 

So what is MBI--and you touched on this a little bit ago--what is MBI going to be doing in the months to come and in the medium- to long-term?

Tom Hardiman 

Well, right away, we're going to encourage our members to submit comments. And again, that's that regulatory short term piece. So that's happening. We are currently reaching out to congressional reps. The challenge here is we have everyone does high inflation across everything costs more now than it did a year ago. We also continue to have affordable housing crisis. We have numerous developers affordable housing developers To utilize modular because it, it lets them get more housing inventory on the streets faster and more economically, this will take that tool away from them. So we not only plan to rally our industry, we want to talk to those housing authorities at state and local level to say, look, this is going to impact your ability to provide housing and your communities. And that is something that political leadership will be tuned into a crisis. Now, this is only going to make it worse.

So that intermediate term, we're going to do a lot of visits with congressional reps, get them writing letters to the administration and Department of Labor, find out who our allies are on this issue, we've got several trade groups that are opposing Davis Bacon expansion as well, several housing authorities. And then like I mentioned earlier, not a hollow threat, we will seek an injunction on this, if it if it gets to that we will hire legal representation and fight in court. And that's a long and messy and expensive battle.

But honestly, I think this has the potential to to hit our industry and reduce the size of our overall industry by as much as 20%. So that's a multibillion dollar risk that we're looking at. I think it's well worth it for us to fight this with everything we've got.

John McMullen 

So what can members do to stay engaged as this goes forward?

Tom Hardiman 

Well, certainly, you know, hopefully, they're listening to this podcast, and they're, they're educated on the issue. The Davis-Bacon Act is a huge, cumbersome, multifaceted act. And it's, it's really hard to grasp all the aspects of it. So try to stay educated on what it is and how it impacts your business.

Look, if we send these emails out--and we will be updating alerts--take action. Please read those emails and follow up with us. Or if they're just have a question about it, they can email me at tom@modular.org, or our government affairs director, Jon Hannah-Spacagna, and just say, "I'm not sure how this impacts me, help me out." We'll be glad to have those calls.

We're going to be doing some town hall calls coming up in the near future with our members just to, again, get the word out and educate everyone that we have set up a regulatory relief fund, because we know, this is not only gonna be the biggest issue facing us, it's gonna be the most costly issue facing us. And we're gonna need some members stepping up and supporting us through voluntary contributions to that regulatory relief fund.

And sadly, this isn't going to be the only issue we have. And it would be great if we could just set aside all of our other state and provincial issues and only focus on this but that's not reality. You know, we're gonna have to keep fighting all those other issues on top of this, this massive expansion, so help support the funds. They educated, email us with any questions they have about about this and and share it with. If you're a contractor or developer, talk to your manufacturers about this and how it's going to impact them. We want to hear from them.

John McMullen 

Well, I really appreciate your time today, Tom. I said at the top: this is a critical issue for the industry to understand the implications of so I really appreciate you taking the time to explain it.

Once again, I'd like to encourage our members to keep an eye on their email. Keep an eye on the Government Affairs section of MBI's website modular.org. For up to date news and developments. As Tom mentioned, we'll also have town halls that you can join. And if you're not a member, this is a great time to join so you can stay on top of this and all the other issues that MBI is tackling. Thanks again to Tom. I appreciate it.

Tom Hardiman 

Thank you, John, and stay tuned. It's a it's a big issue and it's one that MBI is prepared to fight.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Getting from Offsite to Onsite: Inside the Logistics of Modular Construction w/ Stream Logistics

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Carson Holmquist, CEO at Stream Logistics. Carson is here to talk about the critical role that logistics plays in the modular building process.

Carson, thanks for being here.

Carson Holmquist  

Great to be here, John. I'm glad to be on the show and to talk about offsite construction.

John McMullen 

Well, it's great to have you and it was great to meet you and your team at World of Modular last month. You guys were exhibitors and I just wanted to ask before we get going: Was it a good experience for you? Was it a good show?

Carson Holmquist  

It was incredible. It was even better than we had thought. It was our first year at World of Modular. We met some incredible people had some fantastic conversations, and we will certainly be back next year.

John McMullen 

Excellent. Excellent. And I'll give a quick hat tip to your colleague, Mandy, she listens to the show and connected you and I, so I appreciate her efforts. And I look forward to seeing you both again next year.

So, tell me about yourself. What's your background, Carson?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, I grew up in a small town in Arizona, I was the son of a small business owner. So, I always grew up knowing I wanted to start a business and didn't know at a young age what that would be. But I went to school at Arizona State University, studied Business and Entrepreneurship and landed an internship at a logistics company during college. They were a startup—a fast-growth company. And I not only fell in love with the entrepreneurial process, but with logistics and have dedicated my career to it ever since.

John McMullen 

So, what about logistics drew you into it? It's not something that maybe everyone, you know, is drawn to.

Carson Holmquist  

Yeah, I think the biggest thing that drew me to it was how challenging it is and could be. And it also presents a ton of opportunity. It's a massive part of what we do in our economy. I think at one point it was 10% of our GDP was built on the backbone of logistics and supply and supply chain. So a lot of opportunity. It was challenging. And every day, I could come in and learn something new. So the longer I was in it, the more I fell in love.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. That's awesome. And I was looking at your website before the interview and you use the term “high stakes freight.” Why did you choose that? And what does that mean to you?

Carson Holmquist  

Yes, that's a that's a term we coined for the type of freight we love to manage. The opposite of that would be routine freight, which is normal dock to dock freight, it's most of the freight that's shipped around the country. And that is relatively easier on a complexity scale. But “high stakes freight” is defined by the risk in the shipment. So, they have to go right or it's going to cost the manufacturer or the receiver of the product thousands of dollars in delays, or could cause reputational damage, or even could cause a relationship to be broken, if it's just not done well.

So we love the challenge. I personally have a passion for solving difficult things. So in all of my logistics experience, I was always drawn to the challenge of creating solutions for things that were very difficult or high risk. So we would assume the risk and create processes that were more bulletproof than would otherwise be assumed. So we love high stakes freight. That's all we do here at Stream Logistics.

John McMullen 

So tell me about the logistical challenges of modular construction and offsite construction—that seems to fit the bill of “high stakes freight” pretty well. What all is involved for modular and offsite and what don't most people think about?

Carson Holmquist  

Yeah, it's a very complex environment. That's why we love working in the offsite industry. I like to think it is very similar to a symphony. And in a symphony, there's lots of different instruments from string to brass, woodwind, percussions, and there's dozens of individuals playing those instruments. And they all have to come together in perfect harmony and pitch in order to capture that, that perfect “symphony sound.” And if anything is off, it just becomes noise, right?

So the symphony conductor plays that role of keeping pace and organizing all the individuals. And that's the role we play in offsite construction. We’re working with the factory and at the factory. We're working with several individuals like the project engineers, project managers, the team that's actually loading the modules onto the truck. And then obviously, we have to coordinate the driver and make sure they have all the information they need to be able to pick up and deliver successfully. And on the site, we're working with a site superintendent who's managing the flow of the project. And ultimately, we're working closest with the set crews because we have to keep pace with what the set crews are doing and makes or that they always have a box available when they're ready for the next one.

So there's a lot more involved in it than people assume. Because if done well, we're playing the conductor for that entire process. And we're the central command of all communication and planning between all of those parties. So it's, it's a lot more intricate than would, then one would assume, if they hadn't experienced it.

John McMullen 

I like that analogy a lot of the symphony and the conductor—that makes a lot of sense.

What role does the conductor have in conducting the technology, so to speak; what role does technology play in what you do?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, as a conductor, a lot of it is human interaction and human intelligence, creating the planning and doing the communication. But we are, we are a technology company, all of our tech talent technology is proprietary, we have a software that runs everything we do on the back end. And what we try to focus on is automating the things that are predictable and routine on the back end, to free up our team, to be incredible communicators, and to be able to fly out to job sites and problem solve. So we use technology to free up our people.

We also have what we call a project command portal, where the whole process is summarized and visible for all stakeholders in the process. So they can log in and see the progress of individual trucks or the progress of the entire project as a whole. And it's a good way to organize all of that activity in one visual sight.

John McMullen 

Awesome, that sounds very cool. So, given all this technology at your disposal, and all these tools that you have, what are some of the factors you consider when you first get involved in a project? How do you apply all these tools that you have?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, I think the majority of the work—or at least the intellectual work—has to be done before a project even begins to make sure the project goes smoothly. So we have pre-project processes that that we follow with every project to make sure that we're setting ourselves up and all the stakeholders up for success. So it's really elaborate, we have to look at the constraints of the project, whether that's at the factory or the job site, we have to think about the pace. How many boxes are going to be shipped per day and delivered per day? What's at stake? Like, if something's late, what occurs? Is there a plan B? Or is it the job site shuts down? Or to think about the loading and unloading, we have to think about the site ingress and egress make sure trucks can get in and out efficiently, and the communication preferences between all the parties. So there's a lot involved.

That's why we have our pre-project process, which also includes flying out to the jobsite and a factory to make sure that we see these loading processes and look for any ways to make improvements. We see the job site to make sure that trucks can pull in to the proper location where to the crane pick points and make sure that another truck can be staged right behind it to make sure we're being efficient. We want to look at the staging yard where these things are gonna be stored nearby. So, we invest a lot in the process in the beginning to make sure that things go smooth once the project begins. It's essentially making sure we can control the controllables because we know that the uncontrollables will still happen.

John McMullen 

So you've got these people on the job site. And you've got people I guess, at home base managing some things…What are they doing during the process? And at what point does your team get involved in the entire modular build?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, we get involved hopefully as early as possible, because if we think about offsite construction, as a system, we do want to consider transportation as early as possible, including in the design phase.

There are opportunities to gain efficiencies by designing the module sizes or how they're handled, you can capture some transportation advantages if you think about it early enough. But we certainly get involved once things are starting to ship. Obviously, that's where our, our pre-project process begins. And our team is that central command for all communication and planning.

So, the main thing we're doing is scheduling the trucks in the flow in which they need to come in and deliver to make sure the project is hitting its timeline milestones. That's the main thing we're doing. But during a project, a lot of things come up, whether it's delays at the factory, you know, weather delays or other delays at the job site. And so we're constantly changing the plan on the fly. Our job is to be adaptable and responsive to any changes in the process to make sure that everything downstream of that change also gets updated. To make sure there's no sacrificing in the quality or the impeccability of the delivery schedule, just because something comes up.

John McMullen 

So tell me about how you load and prepare a module for shipment what has to happen before the truck starts moving to the job site.

Carson Holmquist  

Well, that's part of the pre-planning process as well as we want to see what their normal processes are for loading for securing to make sure that the boxes are wrapped properly with some sort of boat wrapping or something that's going to make sure it's safe during transit. We've been inside of so many factories and been involved in so many projects, we often have some experience we can share to help that process if we see something being done. That puts the modules at risk or the schedule at risk.

So, a lot of it is education, it's understanding, and it's also working with drivers that have experienced handling these projects, so that they can also add some advice. But we have to make sure that the trailer type matches what's needed, we have to make sure it's secured properly, and make sure it's ready for transit so that we don't have any unexpected damages or any delays that will affect the job site process flow.

John McMullen 

So backing up a step—and you alluded to this earlier—what can designers do and manufacturers do to make sure that their buildings are easier for you to get from A to B?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, I mean, we would certainly like the module to be as small as possible, so that there's more opportunity for different trailer types. And you're opening up the option pool as wide as possible. However, we know that there's trade-offs from a design standpoint. So those are things to be considered. The larger the module, the more limited you are on what types of trucks that it can fit on and the more expensive they become, because then you have to start getting permits for transport or police escorts or regular escorts, even route surveys. So these things add up and it becomes very expensive. And the more savvy manufacturers are starting to consider their box sizes in their earlier in the process.

So, they can design to optimize for transportation, because even if you make them smaller, yes, you will have more shipments, but you could still capture cost savings, because it's so much less expensive. And you also increase the number of trailers available. So instead of using custom mod trailers with hydraulics, which are, you know, which are common in the industry, but they're very limited. You could put them on more common carriers like flatbeds, step decks, RGNs, and there's probably a couple orders of magnitude more trailers available out there. So it's easier to scale and easier to have the capacity you need to deliver.

And it certainly opens up a wider delivery radius, if you have a box size is more reasonable, something like I think 12 feet wide, 10 feet tall, 40 feet long is pretty optimal to really increase your optionality and reduce costs and transportation. But that puts challenge on the designers to try to figure out, you know, how to capture the vision of the livable space while having a smaller box. Right?

So those are all things for them to consider. We understand there's trade-offs, it can always happen. But the smaller the box has the user easier it is to manage the shipments.

John McMullen 

How about on the other end of the equation? What can the builders do to increase efficiency once the modules are on site and ready to be offloaded?

Carson Holmquist  

I think that's all about the site logistics plan. How well have they set up things, like the staging yard? And how much space do they have to stage the second truck behind the truck getting off loaded to make sure there's a proper flow? And how good is the set crew? That makes a really big difference as well. So I think those are big things to consider.

We've consulted on all of those processes, because we've seen so much. But ideally, you have a staging yard that's close to a job site. And onsite, you know, you have your crane pick point where you want to have another truck staged right nearby that's getting prepped, you know, getting the wrapping taken off, getting everything prepped so that as soon as that module gets picked, that truck pulls out and the second one rolls underneath so that there's a nice flow to the project. And when think those things are done well, the project usually is very efficient, and the timeline goals are usually met.

John McMullen 

So I imagine it's clear: you have a lot of experience with what you're doing. With all that experience, I have to imagine that there have been some rather significant challenges that you've had to deal with over the past several years. Can you tell me about one of those? How did you meet that challenge?

Carson Holmquist  

Yes. I think every project has its own unique challenges to say they any of them go perfectly smooth, I think wouldn't be accurate. But yeah, we've we had one recently it was a affordable housing project in downtown LA and the accessory is really difficult. We were able to overcome that with a really good site plan. We had to get a staging yard nearby. Everything is set up. But like most projects, we ran into delay starting at the factory where production schedule is slower than anticipated. So we had everything planned with the drivers we have to make adjustments. Then once the modules started flowing to the staging yard, we started running into weather delays and we couldn't install on site. And it ended up being the better part of two weeks. And there ended up being 10 or 11 days where there were no deliveries when we're supposed to have four to six a day.

So then all of the inventory started building up at the staging yard, we had put a hold on that we had to cancel drivers for during that time period. And ultimately, we were able to make up for a lot of those delays, because of how efficient we were by putting two, two shuttle drivers on from the staging yard to the job site where they're constantly flowing back and forth. And we had a really good staging area near the crane pick point so that that second truck was always ready. And the set crew, which happened to be pro set on this job, did a really good job, you know, being efficient and coordinating with us to make sure we were able to make up for that timeline. But it was because there was a lot of really good effort and recovery on our side and on set crusade and even at the factory level. So it can be done. But there will always be delays that are unexpected.

John McMullen 

You've been in the industry 10 years now, I think. How has logistics for offsite and modular changed in that time? What have you seen come? What have you seen go?

Carson Holmquist  

Well, the trend I see maybe I see it very clearly—because I'm kind of pushing for it—is kind of moving away from these custom mod trailers, these custom mod frames that a lot of companies were built off of. I think that was a model was primarily inherited through the mobile home industry. And there's already some infrastructure in place and a lot of manufacturers inherited that process, which does actually work well, when you have enough capacity.

But what we're constantly hearing from factories today is that we don't have enough custom mods. And we don't have enough drivers who can hold these custom mods. And so they're kind of trapped in their own business model, and all of their processes in the factory have built around these custom mod frames. So a lot of our advice, especially with these early factory builds is, “Hey, really think critically about if you want to build that system, because you're going to kind of be married to it, or at least it can be difficult to change your processes.”

And what we're trying to push for is leveraging these carriers that are already out there, these trailer types that are way more abundant. And you're basically tapping into infrastructure that's already in place so that you don't have to go buy custom mod frames as you scale every time you scale. Like there's a one of the biggest modular builders in the country, I heard just went bought 50 more frames, which shouldn't be something they need to spend their precious capital on when they're trying to grow. So if they have a different business model, they can tap into just public infrastructure that's already in place and leverage trailers that are that are readily available. So I think that's a trend I'm seeing. We're encouraging as well. I think there's more scalability, and there's cost savings to be captured there. But there's a lot of work to be done in that arena as well.

John McMullen 

Do you see anything coming up on the horizon, things that might, you know, change how logistics is done over the next 10 years?

Carson Holmquist  

Yeah, there's several things, I think, smaller pop-up factories, those are gonna be really critical, where they're putting the manufacturing near the demand. I think, obviously, shortening the miles traveled, puts less pressure on transportation, there's still all the same complexity, but you have less mileage for things to possibly go wrong, and it's a little less expensive. I think that's going to be critical. I think continuing to think about different ways to build whether it's, you know, smaller box sizes, or, you know, things like what box was doing, you know, something more collapsible for transport. Transportation is a critical component. And it's a very, it's an expensive blind item in the process. So anything you could do to make it less expensive and make it more efficient, the more successful I think a factory could be. So I know that people are considering more creative aspects than then were considered maybe in the last 10 years.

John McMullen 

So, last question. It’s something I like to ask: You were inspired to get into the logistics field many years ago. What advice would you have—not that you're looking for competition necessarily—but what advice would you have for the next Carson who is interested in logistics who wants to get into the module and offsite arena? What would he need to know that he might not know now, that would help him along in his career?

Carson Holmquist  

I think what helped us is when we solely focused on high stakes freight and offsite logistics, because then your whole day is consumed by thinking about the challenges and the opportunities within the industry. Because if you're trying to serve many different industries, you dilute the experience, you know, across different industries and right now we're seeing more than anyone else. So our density of repetition is really high.

So, we're seeing project after project and every single time we learn something that makes us even better. So we've got a flywheel effect in place. But it's only because we decided to solely focus on this industry and invest in the industry, knowing that knowing that we can make a difference knowing that these solutions are needed. And knowing that this, this industry has a bright future ahead of it. And we want to play a role in that. So if we really want to make an impact in this industry, I don't think it serves us to serve other industries at the same time.

John McMullen 

Well, Carson, I really appreciate your time today. Again, it was great to meet you guys at World of Modular and I hope to see you again next year. And hopefully, hopefully, we can talk again before that.

Carson Holmquist  

That sounds great. Thanks, John. Thanks for everything you do. We listen to you often. And it's a big help for us to continue to educate ourselves and learn trends in the industry. So, we appreciate you.

John McMullen 

Well, thank you very much.

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Designing Net Zero Modular Buildings w/ SCMS Associates

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Stuart Cameron, Managing Director and Co-Founder of UK-based SCMS Associates. Stuart is here to talk about his firm's work in the modular construction sector, and in particular the importance of sustainability and modular design.

Stuart, thanks for being here.

Stuart Cameron 

No problem. Thank you for having me.

John McMullen 

So, tell me about yourself, Stuart. What's your background and how did you get involved with building engineering and how did SCMS come to be?

Stuart Cameron 

So, I'm currently the Managing Director and MMC lead for SCMS, who myself and a colleague from a previous company, co-founded over half a decade ago now. My background has always been in engineering and construction, having left school—what feels a bit of a lifetime ago now—and going straight into an apprenticeship with a mechanical contracting company in the north of the UK, where I served my time, both on the tools and in the design office, eventually earning my stripes as an installation engineer.

It was from there when I felt I gained enough experience practically, that I was fortunate enough to go to university part time while getting hands on experience at MEP design consultancy, where I managed to get myself a couple of degrees in building services, engineering and sustainability.

From there, I made the decision to move south to the capital, London, which afforded me the opportunity to work on a lot more prestigious schemes, such as the Houses of Parliament, get experience overseas projects in places like Middle East. It was after a number of years working at a larger multidisciplinary organization where, as I say, myself and my colleagues were employed, that we just felt we could do a better job and offer a more tailored non corporate service to our clients. So, we decided to take the plunge, establish SCMS, and we haven't really looked back since.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. So, have you guys incorporated modular projects since the beginning or is that something that you've just added?

Stuart Cameron 

So ultimately, something we incorporated as a key service in the very early days of SCMS. We recognized that MMC especially was going to be a huge part of the future of the construction industry, not just here in the UK, but worldwide as well. We took the attitude that we'd rather be ahead of the game, rather than playing catch up when it eventually did. So we started very much modularizing our approach and our MEP designs for traditional clients, which then caught the attention of a number of prominent modular suppliers, both here in the UK and Europe, who invited us to assist on prototype works, research and development, the FMA, etc., which eventually snowballed to today where we've established ourselves as the, if not one of the, leading modular MEP consultants, having delivered and worked on a whole range of modular schemes here in the UK, Europe, the Middle East, and further afield as well.

John McMullen 

Well, that's got to be something to be very proud of. That was a prescient decision you made incorporating that so early.

I know modular right now is booming in the UK, and I know in the UK things are very different than here in the US. I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about those differences, like what types of buildings is the industry in the UK focusing on? What do you know about the differences between the UK sector and the US?

Stuart Cameron 

Yeah, sure. So, modular is actually very active here in the UK, in Europe, which is great. There seems to be a lot of buy-in and encouragement from a government level as well to utilize modular moving forward. I think everybody recognizes that the only way to meet our housing shortage in a reasonable timeframe is to utilize modular as well as traditional construction methods, which I can understand. I think it’s a little bit different to what's happening in the US where, obviously, politics can be a little bit more fragmented. There's a huge focus at the minute on housing over here in modular, both affordable and private. This is largely driven by the shortage of both, which is not just unique to the UK, but very much a worldwide critical issue.

I think it was at your conference in April, where somebody mentioned there's a 7 million housing shortfall in the US alone, which just blows my mind a little bit. Where I think we differ from the US as well is, we're very driven by sustainability and net zero as a primary goal. Rather than just delivering meanwhile homes that are affordable to buy, are quick to build. We focus on making an impact on reducing the amount of carbon, reduce the amount of energy used to operate the home, the operating costs to the occupants. That's not just with high performing fabrics, or low air tightness, but the use of low carbon technologies as well, such as air source heat pumps, photovoltaics, LED lighting, and battery storage, etc., etc. From that we have a number of net zero modular schemes here in London, which exceed the 100% carbon reduction target, that is a requirement of net zero.

We have one in particular, which have been nominated for a net zero award at the end of this month, which we've got our fingers crossed for. I also think another area where we differ is that a lot of what's being built, using modular over here is done so in steel, although we do have some schemes where we are utilizing materials such as CLT, SIPS, or glulam. It is actually very rare for anybody to do stick built here.

John McMullen 

Thank you for that, I think, a great breakdown of those differences. You mentioned sustainability. That's certainly one of the big differences. I know here, it's becoming more of a priority, but I don't think it's nearly quite as big of a priority as it is in the UK and Europe, but let's talk about SCMS. In particular, how did sustainability become a big focus for you? What was the genesis of that?

Stuart Cameron 

So, for us, sustainability is actually one of our core values as a business. We recognize as chartered engineers, we've got a responsibility to engage and educate not only our clients, but our colleagues, families, friends, and hope that with the use of our knowledge, effectively and readily in execution and performance, we will enact change on a global scale. Also, by being headquartered in London, which is probably one of the most sustainably forward planning cities in the world and is leaps and bounds ahead of anywhere else in the UK in terms of targets and requirements, we’re always challenged to be forward thinking and measured and what we can achieve sustainably.

John McMullen 

So, are there are there particular goals that SCMS has in regards to sustainable design or other metrics that you use? If so, what are they?

Stuart Cameron 

Yeah, so I mean, our first goal is always net zero, which is a buzzword at the minute that's the tip of everybody's tongue these days. As a local authority required here in London itself, and also as a desired target for a lot of private modular developers it's our first step. Now, whenever developing any of our briefs, we're also very conscious of the mayor of London's target for a zero carbon London by 2050. Obviously, the 2015 Paris agreement that the UK signed up to along with 170 other countries, which not entirely sure the US did, with an aim to limit the global average temperature rise to no more than one and a half degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

So, we've always got that at the back of our minds. In terms of metrics, there's quite a few available tools here in the UK. We have a centralized set of building regulations for the entire United Kingdom, which makes it a little bit more simple. We've obviously recently updated those on the 15th of June. We've also got things like BREEAM, LEED. We also have the future home standards, which are due in 2025. LETI, you know, the wealth standard for offices. So, there's many available to us and it all depends on the type of scheme to which one is more suitable for that particular project.

John McMullen 

So, tell me about some of the projects, modular projects that you guys have designed. You alluded to some a few minutes ago, how was sustainability emphasized? In some of the projects you've done in London, for example.

Stuart Cameron 

Yeah, so the majority of our modular project sustainability is actually prioritized, and not just emphasized. So, it's in there as one of the critical items to be established in the same way that a project size or massing would be giving the same amount of importance to sustainability, as you would say, to how a building looks or how many apartments may have for scalability. In one particular case, where we have a rollout of a targeted 2000 modular homes here, which is across numerous sites, our first priority was each and every scheme had to achieve net zero. This is a mix of individual houses and apartment blocks. The big reason behind that is the end user client is a local authority that the London Borough of Greenwich, and part of the Greater London Authority who establishes the targets for achieving net zero. They have to be seen doing it themselves as well as just stipulating a requirement to private developers. In order to do that, we worked with numerous offsite modular manufacturers and issuing a standardized approach was maintained across all of the schemes.

We also took a fabric first approach to minimize things like heat losses, energy usage, heat gains, passive cooling and ventilation, things like that. So, we elected to use fabric details new values, which again exceeded the requirements of the future hold standard, which I mentioned previous and isn't actually due until 2025. We utilize things like high performance triple glazing, ensured we had dual aspect windows to deal with natural cooling and passive vent. Then it's only from there when we start to look at low carbon technologies such as monoblock air source heat pumps, which provide heating and hot water for the dwellings, photovoltaic panels to generate enough electricity to cater for regulated electrical loads mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, and then the right ones such as you know, LED lighting and advanced controls with weather compensation and things like that.

Another place where we've really had to think outside the box is a modular hotel project, which is completely off grid, and not easily accessible from the mainland, because it's on an island in the middle of the North Sea. So, the challenge wasn't just how much carbon we could reduce, but how to actually make the building function without the need for dirty big diesel generators, in the absence of a functioning power grid.

John McMullen 

I'd love to see a case study on that. That sounds amazing. What can you tell designers and engineers who have the goal to create more sustainable modular designs? These may be people in the US, as we're becoming more and more forward thinking in our designs. We're lagging behind the UK, I'm sure. What can you tell these designers and engineers that might help them create more sustainable designs? What goals should they be setting?

Stuart Cameron 

So, when we look at sustainability, we obviously we don't just see it as a measured target of a reduction of something, we also see as a better way to manage and undertake designs to ensure that it’s installed in a more sustainable way. We're talking all the way through to minimizing waste in the factories and on site, ensuring as much as completed within the factory as possible thereby reducing the frequency of vehicles to site and the number of journeys that equipment is making before it's eventually used by the occupant.

We would like to see as a first goal and step in the right direction, that MEP is actually one of the first priorities when it comes to modular designs, and not just by selecting a super-efficient air source, heat pump or split unit that has a CLP and five plus and then throwing in some pipe work as an afterthought, but actually looking at how MEP will communicate with both the structural and architectural elements of the modules it serves. I think if you take that first step, then the rest should be pretty easy to follow, and it won't seem such a radical change from what's currently being done. Now.

John McMullen 

You mentioned MEP a lot there. You anticipated my next question. I know that besides sustainability SCMS puts a great deal of effort into its MEP design, what can you tell me about that and the interrelation between MEP and sustainability?

Stuart Cameron 

So obviously, MEP design is super important to us. It's not just a core service of ours, but essentially our bread and butter. We feel it's critical to ensure our fundamentals are refined and we strive to deliver excellence with success in mind, always aiming high for our clients as ultimately, we're accountable to challenge and innovate preconceptions for economic growth and sustainability. There's two ways we've really focused in on how our MEP design can be more efficient and sustainable.

Firstly, that's by our adoption of BIM. So, we made a business plan decision back in 2018 that every design we undertake will be managed and coordinated under the principles of BIM at no extra cost to our clients, as it's become a primary method of delivery, not just something special we do every three months. So, every design project is coordinated, and clash detected in the 3D digital environment long before it goes to a factory for onsite construction. This is an area we're quite proud of actually. Recently, our fantastic BIM Team have just secured our ISO 19 650 accreditation for the practice, which is industry recognized for full BIM compliance. I believe we're one of the first dedicated MEP consultancy practices to have this in the UK. So, we're pretty happy with that.

The overall area we're putting a lot of effort into is how the MEP elements are installed, by the way in which we design them. For example, one of the biggest areas of error in the construction industry is unfortunately human and there's no getting around that. We need people to build and install and we're all susceptible to making mistakes. We're only human. However, we've taken a lot of inspiration from the car manufacturing industry and how they not only build cars but fit them out as well. A good example of this is when you see a dashboard being fitted into a car, it's not by a person coming in with a tape measure and then cutting something to size and then click into place and adding the ancillary such as speedometer and fuel gauge, but they come as a pre-assembled product. They come as 1000 pre-assembled products. And lo and behold, every BMW that comes off the line looks and has the exact same dashboard as the car before it.

Obviously, there are other car manufacturers available, of course, but we want to take the same principles in our designs and make MEP more of a product than an install. We do that via taking the dashboard approach and we create models for every piece of assemblies that can be manufactured offsite, somewhere in there hundreds and 1000s and then brought to a factory or a site and be simply connected into place, saving time, money, materials, while also prioritizing sustainability, quality and the modular element.

John McMullen 

That's really cool that you brought up the car manufacturing. I know a lot of our members here in the states have taken a similar inspiration looking at how Toyota manufactures, how different car manufacturers around the world put together their products, and that seems to be a recurring theme. I think there's huge potential there. I'm excited to hear that you guys have embraced that.

So, tell me about the rest of your year. You've done all these amazing projects. Tell me about what's on tap for you for the rest of the year, maybe next year? What projects are you working on at the moment?

Stuart Cameron 

So, as I mentioned, we've just finalized our designs for this off grid hotel, which the island where that's going to sit is a famous bird watching island off the north coast of Scotland. That's now moving into fabrication and should be built by October hopefully. Otherwise, the island becomes very difficult to reach due to weather. We're quite all excited to see that one come to fruition. As I say it's a unique project, which there's not many of in the world.

We're also three years into a delivery framework, which is I think 10 years extendable to 13 for the Royal Borough of Greenwich here in London, which at the minute is the largest modular affordable housing scheme in the UK, where we've got several schemes at various stages, whether that be design, construction, or handover. On the horizon, we've got several schemes we're hoping we'll get the green light, such as a modular hotel we are hoping to collaborate on with another Modular Building Institute member over in Vancouver, Canada. We're also hoping to get involved in our first modular project in California in the US, which is also a hotel project.

We're also involved in a 300 plus residential unit scheme in Cardiff, Wales, which is currently in for planning at the minute, and we're hoping that we'll get approval any day now. We've also got a plan to take what we know and have learned in the residential hotel student markets to the commercial market. So more so in the office fit out scene to see if we can enact the same amount of change and efficiency in that sector using modulars we have done in the office.

John McMullen 

Sounds like very full slate. One more question for you. I like to ask this of people. Look, you've told me about the rest of your year, you've got a lot going on. What about the next five or 10? Not just in terms of your projects in particular, but what do you think the industry is headed towards in five to 10 years and we can keep it to the UK because that's where you are and what you know. Where do you see the modular construction industry in the UK in five to 10 years?

Stuart Cameron 

I would like to see it almost on par with the traditional industry as something that's recognized and embraced as a regular construction method. At the minute here, and everywhere else, there's still a small amount of fear when it comes to modular because it was built in a factory. I would say the one thing that's lagging is the contracts out there for it yet. So, it was really difficult for the modular builders to really get a good momentum going.

I would like to see it become the regular or irregular, go to construction method where people are comfortable with fire risk, and getting mortgages and things like this on modular properties. At the minute, a lot of modular buildings that are built go up, they're fantastic, and then people put bricks in front of them to make them look like a traditional building, to hide the fact that it's modular. Whereas I'd rather embrace the fact it's modular units, a new technique well it’s not new. It's been around for a couple of 100 years. Since we were shipping prisoners off to Australia in the 18th century when we put the houses on the books, but it's relatively new to, I guess, the post war population. I'd like to see it embraced in the same way that bricks have been embraced.

John McMullen 

Well, thank you for that. I appreciate it.

I know it's early yet, but you guys mentioned being at World of Modular in April, we were so glad you were there. I hope it was a great experience for you. I was wondering if we could look forward to seeing you in 2023?

Stuart Cameron 

It was a fantastic experience, and we will absolutely be back for 2023 providing, there's no more travel restrictions back into play.

John McMullen 

Don't jinx it! There's going to be no travel restrictions!

Stuart Cameron 

One of my most favorite places on the planet is Vegas, so I’m equally looking forward to that. So much so that we're hoping to be able to host a talk in one of the breakout sessions, just like some of the great speakers did back in San Antonio.

John McMullen 

That would be great. That'd be great. Yeah, just let us know. We'd love to have you that would be fantastic. Thank you, Stuart. Thanks. I know you guys are new members. Thank you for joining, for attending World of Modular, I really look forward to seeing you guys in Las Vegas next March.

Stuart Cameron 

Great. Thanks for having me, John.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Designing One of the Nation's Largest Modular Multifamily Housing Structures w/ Cuningham

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Dave Stahl, associate AIA and principal at Cuningham. Dave is here to talk about the design and development of one of the largest multifamily volumetric modular projects in the country.

Dave, thanks for being here.

Dave Stahl 

Thanks for having me. I'm very excited.

John McMullen 

So, tell me about yourself. Dave, what's your background? And how did you get started as an architect?

Dave Stahl 

So, I started actually in engineering and found that while doing the math, I often doodled on the side and thought, why am I swimming upstream? Let's explore the art side more and very glad I did that.

I went into architecture and graduated about 28 years ago. So I've been doing this for a while. I've always been at the front-end design side. I think that engineering spirit actually helps Well, in the genre I work in I work in multifamily, which is about numbers and how to do things efficiently and where to focus our design efforts and where other things that work well to repeat them.

So, actually, what's interesting is the modular aspect plays into it very well, it is how do we make this machine work and versus trying to make the machine fit, predestined vision that we had before. So that's kind of my architectural background.

I've been with Cunningham for 18 years in two different stints. I started here, had to look out a different window for a while, like all of us need to do and like so much I came back.

John McMullen 

Well, that's awesome. I love the story about doodling in the margins while you were in math class. That was the entirety of my career in math class: doodling. Which leads me to ask, were there any new skills or techniques that you needed to learn going from engineering into architecture? Did you have to rethink everything was could you apply a lot that you had already learned?

Dave Stahl 

I think a lot of the skill sets and I've told this to most engineers, I know and architects, it's like, you could probably you have the skill sets within you to probably do either one. It's whatever your interests dry you. My wife's a graphic designer and does a lot of things. And I tell her it's like, there's again, a lot of overlap and skill sets, there are nuances and details specific set.

Like, for instance, if I had to calculate the load carrying capacity on a beam today, I might have to reference a book or two to get through that. But I do think it's a, we you come with a set of skills that then get honed as you practice or go to school. So, I think I had most of them. And I just am a lot happier doing the creative front end versus figuring out what others have done.

John McMullen 

I hear you. So how about modular design? Did you start out with that? Or was that something that you had to add to your toolkit as you went on?

Dave Stahl 

Well, it's new-ish to my world, I think the first modular building I looked at with a group was probably three years ago. So it's not like I have this 20 years back. So like any good designer, it's learning the skills and what that specific modular fabricator did. And instead of trying to form it to my whims, it's learning. What is it that this does well, and let's propagate that and make sure we express that because that's where you're gonna get the advantages.

So, did that but right now, like you mentioned, we have a large one under construction, finally, huzzah! But I've probably done half dozen to eight buildings quite thoroughly, that three are hopefully starting and the rest, you know, we're one of those “Oh, that was a good exercise.” And for reasons A, B and C, don't go forward.

John McMullen 

Well, let's talk about the project that you're working on, the very large modular multifamily project. Tell me about how that project evolved, how it started, what was your goal, and how was that project coming along?

Dave Stahl 

So, it started via an architectural RFP. They asked a number of firms to propose an interview. I think what gave us the advantage is I was looking at a different modular project in a different city with a developer and was they were looking at Rise Modular, the developer for the project, and work on they were looking at using their factory.

So, before I got started, I talked to the folks there and said, “Give me the beats. What do I do?” Well, what should I do? What should I not do, and kind of learned and we looked at a bunch of different options, some that fit the modular cell that they used well, others, they even explored, like a California wrap around a parking structure. And I remember going well, this is certainly a round peg getting jammed in, too, as well. I'm betting This one doesn't pencil. And sure enough, because you could only use half-length mods, we lost a lot of advantages, but it was an exercise.

Anyway, I got to know the folks at Rise comfortably enough. So, when we went in to the interview, we I knew the right questions to ask, I knew what their strengths were. And then we could spend the time actually getting a couple of steps ahead, for instance, saying, if you're giving me free reign, my whole goal is to give you a building that people say that's a lovely building. And then afterward when you say that's modular, they no kidding. I wouldn't have guessed that. That's my whole goal. Yeah, versus saying yes, I can see it the way it's put together.

John McMullen 

So tell me about the building specifically. Where is it? How many mods are in it? What's the overall shape and size of it?

Dave Stahl 

Okay. Yep, it's in Edina, Minnesota, in the kind of, for those that maybe local, it's the intersection of highways 494, and 100 will be visible from the highway, which is always nice. For those of us that have projects. It is 205 mods, and I believe 210 units. A lot of it is not micro units, for instance. A lot of them have multiple, like they're two or three mods wide for units.

So, it is a market rate has two bedrooms, one bedrooms and efficiencies. And…trying to think…it's a podium project. It's five storys over a precast base for the parking is contained. On top of that podium is a lovely pool amenity deck. And the shape of the building is essentially an asymmetric H shape, almost the sea. But just again, we wanted to make sure that there was articulation and braking. So, of the three wings, the central one that connects to it is pulled back to give some articulation along the street edge make for a better pedestrian experience.

John McMullen 

Did this building go through several iterations? Was it always sort of conceived of as that shape?

Dave Stahl 

Well, there was a master plan that roughly denoted you know, the overall extents of the building, it could have been a C, it could have been two L's you know, there was some of that. But early on, we wanted to make sure that there is some efficiency. So for instance, two L shaped buildings on a podium means two different sets of elevators, extra stair towers required that sort of thing. So we kind of knew it wanted to be one building. And which way the podium oriented, do we want it facing south in the sun? Or did we want it facing toward the rest of the development? This is part of a larger master plan that'll include hotels and restaurants and things. So there was some talk, but we landed on it relatively quickly, because there was a lot of that makes sense.

John McMullen 

So, what was the process of working with the guys at Rise Modular? They’ve been on this podcast; they're great guys. How did you and your team at Cuningham interface with him? What was that process like?

Dave Stahl 

Well, it's actually been really comfortable. Because we all have the end goal in mind to build a nice project, optimize the efficiency of the system they've come up with. We toured the site, I know what it does well, and it's been great. Because we do have that same goal. So whenever there are, huh, this isn't working well, instead of saying, Well, that's what I drew. And we're gonna stick with it. Like, some architects are kind of known. It's like, okay, well, let's work this out and what else you got? Because here are the drivers, let's make sure that we keep those in mind. But how do these buildings, for instance, intersect one wing to the next? There's six ways to do that. Let's come up with one we both like. So, it's been a lot of fun.

And even we've had a former coworker, coincidentally, left here and started working there. Shortly before we got the project, and it's just another friendly face that you're comfortable They left on good terms, you know, people check things out. So, it's been really, it's been very comfortable.

John McMullen 

Awesome, awesome. Tell me about the exterior design features on this project. I mean, you made some very cool choices. How are your design choices affected by this project being modular? Or were they?

Dave Stahl 

Well, there are. So, for instance, early on talking to rise, we talked about exterior facade, and we wanted to make sure there was articulation, because there are some prototypical modular buildings that are simple. And we wanted to make sure there was enough articulation. But on the other hand, you know, this is a multifamily building and its revenues generated by the rent. So you can't build something that you can't pay for, like, for instance, a hospital pays for itself by the beds inside and what's going on. There are realities, if it costs more than you can ever get rent, guess what building doesn't get built?

So, our first generation did every mod, kind of did a stagger back and forth, like, oh, wow, no one's ever going to know this is modular? And just how all of those outside edges would have to come together. Can you do it? Yes. Was it a good use and optimizing how they go together? No. So we focus it, where does your eye go in most buildings, they go to the corners.

So, we have some simple fields. And all of our attention and articulation goes toward the corners. So we have brows and we have some vertical moves that are built after the fact on the outside, again, with the intent to if you can now, realize this as modular we haven't done enough. So that is the nice thing the mods want to be is done is they can be, but the skin, at least with the rise version is done afterwards. So you cover all the seams, you can do moves that span multiple mods and blur that area behind. So I guess, to repeat: articulation happens at the corners. And then the way the wings meet, we spent quite a bit of time on how they bumped up into each other because we wanted to make sure that we weren't covering rentable square footage with other excuse me, other rooms, and we wanted to kind of a light touch so it's almost throats down to Skyway-like connections, although there is rentable space there, but we wanted to kind of narrow it down. Again, maximizing how the mods intersect.

John McMullen 

What stage is this project in now?

Dave Stahl 

So they are starting to fabricate the mods. And here's some Rise tidbits, a refresher if they've already been on, but it takes about 13 days, I'm told, between start of rough pieces to completed mod. While it's 13 days start to finish, their goal is to a day. So that's the route they come on, they have a large space, they essentially get like a boat wrap, shrink wrap, and they get set outside, right in their facility and wait for the time.

They have started the podium. We're still about I believe it's a month or two away from setting mods. But when the mods do come, they're hoping to get between 10 and 12 a day. And they're going to build it with the center link wing first, and then build the left and right afterward because building vertical…they prefer that versus doing all one level and then going to the next…I think it's basically the race to get the roof on.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. With your experience—and you have a lot of it both with modular now and with regular stick built—what are the differences from your perspective, from an architecture point of view and designing traditional stick-built versus modular…What skills have you picked up? What skills have you realized maybe you don't use as much…What's the what are the differences you’ve found?

Dave Stahl 

Well, I'm planning ahead. It's I can't emphasize how certain things we've all heard of projects being fast tracked where you get the foundation permit and you go and you're still designing some of the upper parts. We can certainly get going on some of this but since there is no “in the field, we'll get to that later”, they're putting as much in the mods including light fixtures and appliances and everything as much as they can get in and ship it to. Whether that helps because it's less in and out there less cleaning and that sort of thing afterward. It's really getting your ducks in a row before you run the “Ready Aim Fire” really applies because we've all had clients where it's “ready fire aim”, and “we'll figure it out…we have a good crew, we’ll get there.” Planning ahead. Absolutely getting it all figured out, then going,

John McMullen 

Are there differences with a big modular structure like this one—using just over 200 mods, it's a huge place—designing a big structure like this versus smaller projects, are there differences in how you design for those?

Dave Stahl 

So most of the ones that I personally have been working with have been of a larger scale, and that but I can, just knowing what is going along. There are things about, you know, you want artistic articulation. But the unit behind that should be repeatable. And like I said, you since you have to plan out everything, it would be nice not to have a onesie-twosie unit like this is a unique one. And we took just as long time versus the one next to it that there's a lot of so our opposite corners, you can't see them at the same time, have the same units and articulation and it because we wanted to get some mileage out of that planning and thought process and that sort of thing.

Again, it's about efficiency. We have our areas that are unique, our amenity spaces, our entries, the areas where everyone comes together, all unique when it comes to the unit's hey, if that one bedroom works great there. Let's not have 10 different plans for one bedrooms, let's have two.

John McMullen 

What was the biggest challenge for this project? I mean, obviously, it's a very big and required lots of planning and coordination, the “Ready Aim Fire” as you put it. But was there a specific obstacle that you needed to figure out how to overcome?

Dave Stahl 

To me the hardest was you don't have to match the units across the corridor. Because and I don't I don't mean to repeat what your audience knows. But the mods typically are semi-truck trailer size, and typically spanned from outside wall across the corridor to opposite outside wall.

The part that was new going from a traditional multifamily world was you don't have to have this exact same unit across the way. But those party walls in that mod do have to line up and the way they drop in. So making sure as you go down a hallway and turn a corner. Everything on both sides works together. And sometimes like “Oh, it'd be great. Well put the stair here. Oh, wait, the stair towers, you know, four feet thinner than the mod needs to be. So let's reconfigure it so we're using the space.” So, I think that was where at the beginning. Most of the mental gymnastics were happening. It's kind of like optimizing your Tetris.

John McMullen 

What were some of the takeaways that you took from this project? And what are you going to apply next time you do one of these large multifamily buildings?

Dave Stahl 

Certainly not reinventing the wheel again. So, there are some units that are fantastic. In the future of projects, I'm hoping that we can use them again and everything stays the same. And the, you know, there might be a change to how the mods are made. And there's an improvement. But there's some that it's like these are worth doing again. So take Yeah, taking the best parts, and then building on that and continually improving. So I look forward to getting some mileage out of some that were, you know, you put a lot of thought into it. And they're very nice.

John McMullen 

Very good. What advice do you have for architects, designers, maybe even engineers who are looking into the modular industry, do you have any words of inspiration or warning?

Dave Stahl 

Well, I do have a little event that happened some years ago. And when I was going through this modular process, I'm like, this follows this trajectory quite well. And I'll try to be super brief.

About 20 years ago, the Minnesota AIA had a competition out at the Mall of America for a Lego competition, you know, they call up all the bigger architecture firms and said, Come on out. And what you're gonna build is you're gonna build a bridge. It has to be it has to span 18 inches. That's it.

Other than that, you can do whatever you want. And it's like, okay, well, what will you have was my first question. Oh, we'll have this huge pile of every conceivable part you want and like, “Okay, will you have just the standard bricks, the two by four?” You know, day one, like, “oh, yeah, we'll have those two color coordinated.” Like, all I needed to know. So we got back, we planned a very elaborate, very strenuous hike, it had a s curving thing. There wasn't a straight line on it. But we knew our commodity pieces that two by four brick was on constant. And we planned around just that everything we had to do. And we printed out plans that were to scale. So we could just go on top of it, there was no “What should we do? I think we should do this.” We had pre planned.

So the day of the event, we hit the ground running, and within minutes already had things building up where most teams were discussing and looking at what pieces could do it. To cut to the end. We creamed everybody. There wasn't even a close second, because it was that plan plan plan, then we planned, than we did it.

So the advice would be whichever modular manufacturer are working with, and they are the drivers, learn their system, figure out what they do what it does best, and embrace it. Optimize, go with that, versus “Hey, have you ever tried doing an L shaped mod? Because I have this idea…” No. That's you're just going to take time and money and stuff like that really make a good? And like I said, with that simple, the boring, the most boring Lego piece we had far and away the most interesting design, because we figured out how to use it in a fun way.

John McMullen 

Well, I love that story. I think it's great advice, I was really concerned there that they were going to have no two by four bricks. And you'd have to invent something on the fly. But I'm glad your story had a happy ending.

Dave Stahl 

Yes. And very applicable to a good trajectory for a modular building: embrace it, live it, don't try to “Hey, you know, it'd be cool…Let's try something different.” If they suggested and you work together, great, but for the most part, they're set up for some pretty straightforward approach. You use it to its advantage.

John McMullen 

So now that you've been in the industry for a little while, you've done several modular designs, you got some on the horizon…Do you foresee any changes in designing for modular over the next few years? Are there trends that you see coming or going? What's your, what's your fingers in the wind sense?

Dave Stahl 

Right now, what's really nice about modular projects is, they're built in a controlled environment. You can you can build a car in a parking lot by laying the pieces out, but it's a lot nicer to do it inside with everything organized, and that sort of thing. That's really nice.

Now, that being said, the quality goes up, because the workers are doing the same kind of approach. If you're making cookies, if you're doing 100 of them, you're going to be more consistent than “Hey, this is my first batch, let's see how they turn out.”

I look forward to when some of that might become automated, and therefore offer some more complexity. Because right now, complexity does slow down the process. Let's say you want to chamfer to an outside wall, you can certainly do that. But it's not what the crew is set up to do. And it's a unique thing. I'd like to see some more unique mods that if they if there were certain steps in the process that were automated, would become then much more easy. That would be nice. And also right now, due to how you want self-contained and quality…There's quite a bit of material. It has to be strong. It has to be shipped transported.

It would be nice to see if some very smart engineers, smarter than me, could look at it. And oh, you know, “We can get it just as strong by eliminating 10% of the wood” still because right now, it's beefy. But that's, you know, it does come at…It's about speed. It's not how do you build the building cheaper. It's how do you build it faster? It would be nice. And I do think it will go that way. Once we get the system down better. We'll start optimizing materials and things like that.

John McMullen 

Well, I just want to thank you for your time. Thank you for joining MBI I thought this is a great conversation. I can't wait for the completion of your project. I'm looking forward to seeing much more from you and from Cuningham in the months and years to come. Thanks again.

Dave Stahl 

Well, thank you very much. It's been a real pleasure.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Embracing Steel: How One Manufacturer is Transitioning from Containers to Full Volumetric Modular Construction w/ CRATE Modular

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Rich Rozycki, CEO at CRATE Modular. Rich is here to talk about crates recent efforts to bring steel-framed modular projects to market and about the advantages that automation can offer modular manufacturers.

John McMullen 

Rich, thanks for being here.

Rich Rozycki 

Thanks, John. It's a pleasure to be on the podcast today. I'm excited about it.

John McMullen 

Well, me too. Let's, let's kick it off. Tell me about yourself, Rich. What led you to CRATE Modular?

Rich Rozycki 

So I started my career off as a construction lawyer and in the process of representing general contractors, subcontractors, governmental agencies, I ended up moving in house to Champion Homebuilders. And after a period of time there working primarily as attorney, I took over their commercial group and I ended up leading that group through the Marriott modular initiative and began working with Marriott Hotels. Then I ultimately moved on to Z Modular, which was a steel-based startup that had a proprietary connection technology that allowed us to build really precision based steel structures. And then, you know, as my career progressed, and as Z Modular grew, there became some pronounced opportunities for modular that existed, especially in some markets like California that have an acute need for housing and construction solutions. And a company like CRATE that is located right in the thick of things about 20 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, was a very attractive option here. And, and so here I am now with CRATE Modular had been here about a year. And as you correctly noted, we're making a transition from a container based solution which we were known for, to a more custom, dimensionally flexible, steel-based modular solution.

John McMullen 

Well, that's excellent. You've been all over the place. So that's an exciting history, I'm sure you're bringing a lot to CRATE. So let's talk about your your move into steel. Tell me about CRATE's recent inclusion of light-gauge steel, how was that decision made? And what kind of steel frame projects are you working on?

Rich Rozycki 

So it was really a customer-led decision. We had a customer approached us and asked us if we'd be willing to think outside of our container solution and develop a steel-based modular solution. And so just, you know, kind of looking at the market and understanding the economics of container based building, we thought that, you know, this was a good client that we wanted to grow with, and that this product type of building steel based module solutions, was where we think the company is going to go.

And so our first project, which we're currently building is a four story, multifamily apartment project. It's right here in the heart of Los Angeles. And that's the first of what we think are going to be many projects, we have another one that we're going to be building here in the late fall, that we're also excited about. And honestly, we think it's the future, we think that the opportunity exists to really be able to build, you know, like gauge metal structures from, say, four storeys, and under two hybrid steel solutions that we can provide mid-rise and high-rise steel, modular solutions for.

John McMullen 

Awesome, awesome. So, as you mentioned, CRATE traditionally has been a container-based sort of company. And now you're moving into steel...What challenges, have you faced with steel framed containers--the frame is sort of inherent in the structure--but now you're building your own. What challenges have you faced? And how have you overcome them?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, so for us, the transition from a container based solution to a build your own module solution hasn't really been that big of a transition. That's because as CRATE grew, we started building taller multifamily, and education structures that were, you know, four-plus stories. And, you know, when you're doing that with a container, you have to do a lot of structural reinforcements. So there's welding, there's, you know, additions of support that that need to be added.

And so, as we looked at things, and really, as we looked at the types of projects we were building, we thought that potentially we could come up with a more economical solution. And so when our customer came to us and said, you got this opportunity, we looked at and jumped at it. And so the challenges that we've faced have really been more in the, you know, as we look at more and more of these, these steel based projects, the challenges are really in the standardization of the designs and the assemblies. And so what I mean by that is really fire assemblies. You know, there's not a host of, you know, standardized, approved, UL Listed modular-rated fire assemblies. And so that leads to different interpretations of the code and potentially different details that a design team may put into the project to achieve a certain fire rate.

And so, you know, what we're seeing is the need to try to bring some standards around that and that is one of the reasons why we are moving towards the creation of a "CRATEolog," which is essentially a rules-based design catalog that we're developing that has a lot of the information that a design team would need to be able to lay out a building around our CRATE system. And so what they would include is Revit models that have the options for, you know, your wall assemblies, floor assemblies, structural connections, all of the things that you know, kind of are a mystery to a lot of folks, when you go into working on the design of a modular structure, essentially, what we're doing is trying to take that information, do the upfront research and be able to provide that to clients so that we can serve in a design-assist capacity that helps them really get a project designed efficiently around our system, but also on the back end, helps drive the standardization of our product and ultimately increases the throughput through our facility.

John McMullen 

I think it's a great idea. It's an outstanding resource, an outstanding marketing piece, really. I'd love to see a copy whenever it's completed.

I would go back to your history a little bit, you've been all around the modular industry. And I know you've been doing some speaking lately. So I wanted to ask about how to start manufacturing for offsite. Let's use CRATE's inclusion of steel framing as an example. What can you tell other manufacturers who want to start building for offsite construction? Where do they start? And what should they be focusing on?

Rich Rozycki 

Sure, that's a great question. Yeah, where you got to start as the product, you have to have a product that is designed because you need to set all of your company up or all of your manufacturing operations up around that product that you've designed. And so really, what I call that as nailing it, before you scale it, you need to figure out, okay, you know, what are the dimensions going to be? What are the assemblies going to be? What are the order of construction that you're going to perform? And how are those processes going to play out across your production line, and everything really ties back to how the product is designed. Because, you know, in my experience, when we've seen when you run into production issues on the floor, you know, there's a couple of explanations for it.

But a lot of times, it comes back to the fact that maybe there was a detail that hadn't been thought through, or there was more information needed to needed in order to properly complete a installation of a material item. So really, it's all about going back to having that product that is standardized, because then at the end of the day, you can set not only your operations up, but you can set the future of your company up around around that product. Because the more you standardize, the more you can eventually automate. And the easier things become.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. Are there major differences between setting up a factory for wood framing and steel framing, or framing in general, versus a container-based solution like CRATE is known for?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, there's, there are differences. You know, take CRATE, for example, the transition from containers to hybrid and light-gauge metal structures that impacted the initial portions of our line and the bat at the really the end of our line as well. So in the initial portions, with containers, you're doing a lot of demo work, you're having to go in the container and add structural steel versus what we're doing now where we have jigs where we build the frame, the structural framing those we have walls, jigs that we build wall assemblies offline, and then crane them into place. So that has changed a little bit.

And then you know, the the end of the line changes in the sense that with containers, you have really a built in facade with the corrugated metal that's inherent in those with you know, the the modules where you're building them, you have to figure out okay, what is your exterior sheathing, insulation and potentially facade system going to require? So it does, you know, require you to think around, okay, "what are you doing, that you weren't doing before?" So you know, that's a good example.

And then really from from wood frame, you know, in my experience, especially with Champion with wood frame, you can really crank out high amount of value because it's a little less precise. The way that you can go about completing your order of assemblies is a little bit different. And it's a different product type. There's different requirements, that that you have in the building code because what is the type five product general type five building product and you're not necessarily dealing with you know, non combustible type, you know, assemblies and things like that, which are going to change your production processes.

John McMullen 

So you mentioned you mentioned sequencing, tell me how a factory should be laid out. Obviously, putting things in sequential order makes sense. You know, it's a factory setting. But what else do I need to know if I'm making my first offsite factory?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, there's a lot of things. Really, it's the fact that again, going back to the product, you got to be able to set your supply chain up about around that. And then how does that supply chain get distributed to the floor? So really going back to standardizing that product is going to dictate the layout, it's going to dictate how you consume materials, it's going to dictate how you stage and how you deliver. So there's a lot that goes into that. That piece of the equation.

John McMullen 

And I know, you mentioned this earlier, automation is something that is certainly becoming huge in the modular industry. What advantages does automation offer from a manufacturers point of view?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, well, obviously, it provides the ability to enhance your production throughput of certain assemblies. And that goes without saying, but it also allows you to do a couple of things, you get an extremely precise product, because it ends up allowing you to maybe have a higher level of quality control, given the fact that it's being done by a robot.

The other thing is that it allows you to reallocate your workforce. So to the extent that you introduce automation, one of the things that I think is important when you're setting up a manufacturing plant is the ability to cross train your workers so that if you have bottlenecks in the line, you have the ability to rebalance it. And so that's one thing that automation allows you to be able to reallocate those human resources across other areas of the line that are not automated, that maybe are your bigger bottlenecks.

And you know, the other thing is, too, and it kind of, I guess, is one of those things that I guess from a sales perspective, you look at it, when you bring customers through, there's there's really no better salesperson than a robot. So I guess, from that perspective, it does have some benefits as well.

John McMullen 

So going, going back to CRATE's inclusion of steel just for a moment, how did you guys have to change your factory to account for steel construction, whereas before you we're dealing primarily with containers?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah. So we didn't necessarily have to adjust our workforce, what we had to do is adjust our processes. So rather than cutting apart a container, and station one, we built jigs, we're laying out steel, laying up floor joists, laying out our columns, and then welding that all in place. And so it's in some way, skipping a few steps from our traditional process with containers. Because we're starting from scratch rather than having to deconstruct something in order to start adding the materials to it that are going to lead to a finished product.

So yeah, process is the biggest thing. At the end of the day, what we've seen is that, you know, whether it's a wood product, whether it's steel product, whether it's a container product, your bottlenecks are going to be the things that really aren't available to automation, yet, it's going to be your drywall, it's going to be your tile work. And it's going to be things like potentially flooring, but you know, the things that you can automate the framing, the welding, you know, those are all really good opportunities to increase and enhance your your throughput and your quality. But at the end of the day, if your products not standardized, the automation ends up being, you know, in a lot of ways, less efficient than what maybe human your human resources are able to produce.

John McMullen 

Well, I appreciate you bringing us back to automation. I took us on a little detour there. But I've another question for you. Is there a reason why a manufacturer would not want to incorporate some form of automation into their factory's workflow?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, definitely. I think it depends on what you're building and the volume of production that you're anticipating out of your facility. Smaller facilities, lower value, more bespoke products. Those probably lend themselves last automation, then high value repetitive type products. You know, I think that's where at the end of the day can make the most sense. And really the, the theory that we subscribe to CRATE is incremental automation. Our plan is to, you know, be able to standardize our product to the degree that we can, and then be able to do that around a design for manufacturing process, which will then ultimately lend itself to the incremental automation that will help drive the ultimate throughput in our facility.

John McMullen 

So you mentioned "incremental automation." I like that term. Would you recommend, if you had the choice, sort of an all-in attitude with automation? Or do you like the incremental automation that you guys are doing now?

Rich Rozycki 

You know, honestly, I think the incremental automation, at least from my perspective, is the best approach. And the reason being that, even once you introduce those robots, depending on what they are, there is going to be somewhat of a learning curve to understand how those operate, and then also how they fit into your production process. So, you know, the approach that that we're taking as, okay, let's, let's pick something that we know is ripe for automation, say, for example, like a steel framing, plenty of machines that do that, it's very, you know, relatively easy to introduce. And so that's going to be the first step in our process.

But then, as we start to analyze our man hours and where we're getting our bottlenecks and especially now, where the market is going with the constant introduction of new technologies, we're gonna be on that kind of leading edge of "Okay, there's a new technology out there, we know we have a bottleneck here. How do we potentially integrate that new technology to help solve that problem?" Because at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is drive down the cost of building buildings. And and one of the ways of doing that is increased throughput, but also standardized design.

John McMullen 

So what are some of those new technologies that manufacturers have at their disposal besides automation? And how should they be leveraged for new manufacturers?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, I would say one thing, that's not necessarily a new technology, but something that is great, gaining increased adoption across the modular and prefabrication worlds is really the BIM modeling. BIM modeling, and given the advances with it, and the fact that companies like Autodesk are working on ways to have various design software, and manufacturing software talk together...I think we're on the verge of being at a point where you could design a product, an architect could design it, and then you know, we're not too far away from being able to have that automatically convert to some level of shop drawings that are then useful for the plant to be able to, to give, be able to produce the, the modular building.

And so and that's kind of what we're trying to do with the CRATEolog is be able to take that mystery out of it be able to give folks these are the design standards, and by working within these rules, we can short circuit Well, you know, the shaft drying process, which can sometimes be a lengthy, you know, process depending on how much information is contained in the architectural drawings and structural engineer drawings. So, you know, that's one of the ways that I think can, it's not a necessarily a new technology, but at the end of the day, it's one that I think hasn't been melded well with the manufacturing operations. And that's one of the things that we're trying to drive.

But there's also, you know, we're looking at technologies that allow the projected projection of plans onto the floor so that you can really just take all tape measures, really, in some ways, not all thinking, but, you know, that reliance on having some sort of plan that has to be visible, either in paper or on a screen somewhere, it's right there in front of everybody in real time.

John McMullen 

I've seen articles about those. That's super cool.

John McMullen 

What are some stumbling blocks, maybe, what's the biggest stumbling block for a new factory?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, honestly, it's, it's getting the people in place, getting them organized and getting them, you know, your processes nailed down about how you're going to put your product together. And along with that goes, obviously, the supply chain because you can't build anything if you don't have that. And so, you know, I think one of the most critical things is, and we've talked a lot about design being a critical piece of it, but is getting your supply chain established. And that's one of the ways that the BIM technology can help you get your, your supply chain established because of the fact that, you know, the nowadays you're able to basically do your BIM drawings and can put put together a precise bill of materials, which you know, can be digitally tagged to your procurement.

And so utilizing those technologies to help serve your supply chain is really beneficial and that's something that we're, you know, in the process of creating and, you know, without your supply chain, especially in today's world where you have lead times that can extend beyond four or five months, it's very critical to being able to get your product out the door. So that you know if design is one, supply chain is two, and then ultimately, number three is your factory layout and the processes you're going to use to go about building your product.

John McMullen 

So I'm gonna wrap up by bringing everything back to you guys at CRATE. You started the top of the podcast and you told us about some of the new steel projects you're working on. What else is on the horizon at CRATE? Are you guys still doing containers? Have you switched completely to light-gauge steel? What's coming up?

Rich Rozycki 

Yeah, so we are increasingly building light-gauge and hybrid-steel solutions. That is our focus going forward. However, we still have container projects that we're building. And to the extent that our customers want to bill container projects, we're certainly willing to entertain that we've built award winning projects. We've been doing it for a long time. But we really think that based on the customer feedback, you know, folks we talked to in the market that, you know, our our solutions for more dimensionally flexible structures is really going to be driving the business going forward.

John McMullen 

Gotcha. And I know it's early yet, but you guys presented at MBI's World of Modular a few months back. I hope that was a good experience for you guys. Can we look forward to seeing you in 2023?

Rich Rozycki 

Definitely. It was a great experience. We will definitely be there in 2023 I think this year, the World of Modular is in Las Vegas, is that correct?

John McMullen 

That's right, at the Bellagio.

Rich Rozycki 

You can expect to see CRATE contingent, representing us strong there.

John McMullen 

Outstanding. Outstanding. Well, Rich. I really appreciate your time today. Thank you for coming on the show. I look forward to talking with you again soon. And I hope very much to see you at the Bellagio next spring.

Rich Rozycki 

Great. Thanks, John. It was a pleasure being on.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Inside Moxy Oakland: The Bay Area's Newest Multi-Level Modular Hotel w/ Lowney Architecture

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Ken Lowney, President and CEO at Lowney Architecture. Ken is here to talk about his firm's work on the new multi-story Moxy Hotel in Downtown Oakland.

Ken, thanks for being here.

Ken Lowney 

John, it's a pleasure. I love talking about modular. Excellent, you. Thank you for inviting me.

John McMullen 

Well, you're very welcome. Thanks for being here.  So, tell me about yourself, Ken, what's your background and what drew you to architecture in the first place?

Ken Lowney 

Let's see, I grew up in Palo Alto, California, which is now primarily known as sort of the center of the universe for tech, and software design, but back then it was a sleepy, Stanford University suburb. And I, my father is an engineer, he had an engineering company. So and I worked for him for many years through high school and college. So I kind of got the idea of two things. One, I wanted to have my own company, and to, to be a some kind of professional service provider, but that's slightly more artistic inclinations.  So I end up being an architect, you know, my, I was lucky enough to be do a lot of travel growing up in Europe and Central and South America. And, and subsequently, Asia. So just part of my looking at different cultures, has been to the built environment. So looking at their cities, looking at their buildings and architecture, and so that, you know, that really spoke to me. So that's that, that's sort of that or, you know, my first degree is in philosophy. And so I'd always joke, I'd be a lawyer. But I don't want to be a lawyer. I'm married one, and she doesn't want to be a lawyer. So anyway, I'm an architect now, and very, very happy for it. Although I have to say, since I have about 50 employees, I don't do a lot of architecture, I do a lot of contract writing, negotiation, business development, things like that. But still, I enjoy it.

John McMullen 

Well, good. Tell me about your experience with modular design. What when did that begin? And what did what did modular design bring into your portfolio?

Ken Lowney 

Yeah, it happened. Like most things in life, it was just an opportunity. And I took it, and I didn't realize how good it was going to be, frankly, when I started off.  So it was a small 23-unit project in San Francisco for the great developer, Patrick Kennedy, of Panoramic Interest with Panko Builders, and with a now defunct factory called zeta communities. In my firm learning architecture, we we did that it was the first one. So I think you're done had done something in the South Bay, and it didn't come off very well. Just and that was a phasing issue, not a given issue. And so, modular was just new. Right. So that was the first one in San Francisco, the second one in the Greater Bay Area.  And so it's sort of a bunch of first for us was design-build delivery, it was all Revit. You know, we use Revit, all the engineers use Revit, the contractor used Revit, to factories Revit. So we had one model, we all worked on passing around and developers, so that was great. And we built this little building with a rain screen on it was a slab on grade building, zero lot line, built in four days, and was very successful, except that we didn't really know how to build it. So we lost money. The contractor lost money, the engineers lost money think that the developer eventually he made money.

But there were tours given for months and months afterwards. And there's so much interest in modular and what the possibilities just there's another way to build a building was kind of like, mind blowing for people's like, what are you kidding me? We don't have to do it the same stupid way every time? And so that sort of tsunami, if you will, that excitement, that momentum of people being hungry to do something better and different, has continued. You know, and I'm doing, I give a lot of talks in modular--I'm a lot of panels--and, you know, there's a lot of hype. There's a lot of, you know, talk talk talk, there's a lot more talk than action because we don't have enough factories. I mean, as a percentage of what we actually do is there's not that much of what is built is modular, unfortunately, but we need to do more.  So we're getting back to anyway, so this this one little teeny project was the first one we did and that sort of set it off for us. We put all our chips on the table and went after modular and worked with Guerdon on their first type three projects by over two in Sacramento and then started working with, you know, a lot of affordable housing developers.

And, you know, for-profit developers...and now we've sort of spread to all the usual suspects factories in Boise, Idaho. I've done work with CIMC, even some European factories. And we've done most of the work at a factory_OS in Vallejo, here just in California. And it's been, just as a business, it's been a great differentiator for us, because now we've done built 20, you know, complicated, multi level modular projects. And so, you know, an experienced, another experienced architect might have done one. And so like, we it's just wonderful, great. It's just great for us.  You know, even though we've had a lot of success, success as a terrible teacher. And the good thing about modular is a lot of teaching that goes on. So there's always something we learn on our project. But nonetheless, generally, projects come out great, and people are satisfied that they they did modular every now and then we do. There's something that happens, we wish it didn't happen. But you know, we move forward, and we learn our lessons. So anyway, started with a small project, and that we're working with all the big nonprofit, affordable housing developers in the Bay Area. And a lot of market-rate developers.

John McMullen 

Well, you mentioned projects that have turned out great, which is a great segue. Let's talk about the Moxy hotel in Oakland. It's a beautiful building, I believe you guys won an award for it at MBI's recent Awards of Distinction contest. So congratulations on that.

Ken Lowney 

Thank you very much. It was fantastic. We feel very pleased with that.

John McMullen 

Good! I also believe it this is Moxy's first modular hotel. Is that right?

Ken Lowney 

I believe so. But I don't know that for sure.

John McMullen 

Okay...let's just claim it's true. How did your firm get involved in that project? And what were your initial thoughts?

Ken Lowney 

Let's claim is true. So, you know, just how architects get work is somewhat shrouded in mystery. You know, partially it's, you get work from previous clients, you get work from cities, or contractors or developers. I mean, ultimately, a developer that hires you, but how do you get in a position to be hired?  So, in this particular instance, it was the broker who was selling the property to a developer brought me in, and then we sort of took it from there. We partnered with the, the, and that developer partner with another developer, and that developer brought in another architect, which, at first was doing a lot and ended up doing not very much.

So we were the design architect and the modular architects for the project. And it, it's great in a lot of ways, I mean, it's a obviously, it's an infill project. There's no parking. So one of the that's one of the great things about as far as making an economical, you don't have to build a parking structure. So it makes the rooms a lot cheaper. And the main thing from the City of Oakland's standpoint was not that the building had to be built with a union contractor, but that the hotel had to be operated by union members. And so once the client agreed to that, then it was all downhill. Of course, you know, cities love hotels, because of that tax revenue. And just from a business development standpoint, now that it's built and humming along and looks great. It's great advertising for us. We're getting more and more work from that one building. So it's been it's been great for us. And more and more interviews.

John McMullen 

And here we are!

Ken Lowney 

Yeah, exactly.

John McMullen 

Exactly. So tell me about the design process for this hotel. I imagine Moxy gave you some some idea of what they wanted. I'm sure Oakland had some thoughts since this is right in their downtown district. And what other parameters did you have and how did you incorporate everything

So Moxy is definitely has a specific idea of what they want. So it's definitely sort of a younger crowd. The they're, they're very small units. You know, they're every single one is, is a single, there's a double bed and there's no closet. So you're hanging clothes on the wall, there's a wall with a bunch of pegs on it, you hang your pants or your dress or whatever on that. And then there's a nice bathroom but it's pretty bare bones, sort of high design, bare bones. And all each room has a what I would say is that it has an oversized window compared to a normal room. So you feel even though the room is small, it feels quite expansive.

Ken Lowney 

And so it's, it's all up in it fits for really forward thinking younger folks, and so that the decor of the room sort of reflects that and the size of the room as I said, so it's really not, it's really about being, you know, either in the bar below or the restaurant, there's a, there's a adjacent restaurant as part of the project or out of the city walking around. So it's not really about being in your room and watching TV, it's about being in that location was right, it's right, where, you know, a monthly arts fair happens. And there's a bunch of great restaurants and several theaters. So it's a very good location.

John McMullen 

Cool. And this hotel is a hybrid project, I think. It was five levels of modular rooms over two stories of site-built space. How did that affect your design? And are there any general guidelines you follow when designing hybrid buildings versus those that are completely modular?

So I would say 85% of the buildings we do have a podium, which is that concrete structure that one or two levels, and you've got the manufactured boxes on top. So most of our buildings are like that. So we're pretty used to the coordination that has to happen between the site-built portion and the factory -built portion.

Ken Lowney 

Yeah, so you know, the rules of thumb are, you have to just remember that, you know, every box, every six-sided box has six sides, which have depths and dimensions. So if you put that box on top of a podium, your floor level isn't the podium level, it's this new artificial extra bump. And so I mean, it's it's just your stairs are a little bit longer and you manage your elevator differently. But other than that, it's it's pretty much the same as a regular construction for a building. On the Moxy, it was the builder's first time doing modular, so a couple of hiccups. One of them was locating the embeds that were to take the modules on the top is a two level podium. So the embed to accept the modules were in the every one was in the wrong location.

John McMullen 

Oh no.

Ken Lowney 

Right. So just figuring that out. So that would mean that the the, the lines of the walls, which in the in the structural resistance wouldn't line up, the plumbing would line up mean the building just wouldn't work. That was a little bit of a hair raising moment for the builder. So I mean, the drawings were right, but that was just you know, how it happened. We don't know. But we managed to get make it through that and, and get to building obviously, in the podium, the rooms that are in the podium are site built and the rooms that are above the podium, are manufactured in the factory.

John McMullen 

Well, yeah, you just describe something that didn't quite go according to plan. What did go according to plan, what happened that really worked on this project?

Ken Lowney 

Hotels are great for modular because you really want everything in the box delivered, and you don't want people going in and out, of course, hoarsing around with you know, F&E stuff. And so they arrived with very interesting complicated beds that had drawers and shelves in it. And that came off great, right, they're built, they were built installed in the factory. And that was that was wonderful. So the quality is there. And just so that the the separation between the rooms is very, it's all about privacy, right, you've got double walls. And so that works out quite well.  And I would say also that we, for the first time, used a cementitious cladding. So it's a ceramic tile finish. And I mean from some angles, you can see actually I'd never seen it before one of my colleagues said I've seen these little kind of waves in the in the seven-storey building, but I've been surprised when I've been up close and building and looking for imperfections. Because often you know with wood boxes, it's not I mean, it didn't turn out perfect, right. So you have to do some shimming and whatnot. But the the surface of the finished wall came out beautifully. So the contractor did a great job, the subs did great job it looks the simple form of a building but it has a very kind of luscious material. And if it had been kind of lumpy and waving around, it would be less appealing but it just I think that came off great. So that says So kudos to Nashua, the builder, and kudos for Suffolk who's affected and got caught on the box at the right place so that turned out great.

John McMullen 

Well it is it is definitely a beautiful building. One of the features I love is the big Moxy sign. It looks like there's a maze on the front of the building which is very distinctive and very cool. Question for you. Did you have to factor in the weight of that sign?

Ken Lowney 

No, it's very light. It's, it's, it looks heavy, but it's you know, just lightweight bent metal, it's you know, painted.

John McMullen 

Okay, it does look great.

Ken Lowney 

What's great about the building is that roof deck that faces Telegraph Avenue. So you go up, you go in a nice bar, then you can go to the next level. And there's outdoor seating, there's ping pong tables, you can order drinks and food up there. And the cost of that outdoor deck, from a looking at it just from the modular standpoint, was zero. So once it was determined that we had a solid box four or five modules to make the building turn into an L, we realized we could slide that short leg up and down the length of the long leg. And there'd be no no cost, right? There'll be no additional sandboxing or anything. So like, huh, we can push it back a little bit and get this great outdoor space, and not penalize the cost or efficiency of the factory or the stacking or the design in any way. So that was a great realization.

John McMullen 

Was there any part of the process that really challenged you?

Ken Lowney 

No, no, not really. But so one of the challenges for the project was, you know, the, you know, I would say that ideally, for a project like this, it has 170 keys, and I recall, so it's five over two, ideally, for a project like this, you would stack, you know, 10 to 14 boxes a day. And unfortunately, in this instance, we see that we're only able to stack one box a day.

John McMullen 

Oh, no.

Ken Lowney 

Yeah. So so that was very, so that was, you know, partially a learning curve, partially circumstantial, you're in major in the downtown. So that hurdle, you know, slowed down the project a lot. But I would say that was kind of the, the biggest takeaway is, you know, do what you do best. And so there's companies that stack modules, right, like a Proset. And so better to have someone like that do it than to try to do it yourself.  And so they're like, there are some great examples of builders in the Bay Area that do it themselves. But it's, yeah, that was that was the from a project levels standpoint, from that would be the one thing even more, the only embedded issue was the stacking one box a day. So when you think of modular, you think, Oh, it may maybe, you know, save a lot of money, but it's faster. So in this instance, that it was less expensive, but it was just because of the the method that was that they used, it was slower. So anyway, next time, well, of course, it would be faster. But you know, there's always the learning. Always learning, but in the end of the day, you got a beautiful-looking building.

John McMullen 

And, and some and some happy clients, I'm sure. Before I let you go, I'm curious. Your firm has been doing modular projects, big modular projects, for quite a while now. How have you seen modular designs evolve in that time? You know, since your very first project that you mentioned at the top of the show to the Moxy? How have designs evolved? And not just the physical design, but the methodology of the design? What trends are you seeing? What's next?

Ken Lowney 

So there is, from a business standpoint, there was a great opportunity to crack the code on reducing the cost of construction. That plus the opportunity, or the crisis, if you will, the housing crisis. In the Bay Area, California generally says it takes there was I read an article that takes three or four minimum wage jobs, that's $15 an hour to be able to afford a house in California now. So it's insane. Right, right. And so the 10 years ago, there was one factory in California. And now, I mean, we're talking to five or 10 factories that are either headquartered here, maybe they have a factory in Mexico or they've had multiple locations and people are trying to print buildings, we've got people using panelization.  And what what I've seen is the first wave of people coming in, thought that, you know, people that were in the modular industry already or people that were in construction already, were somehow missing the mark. And they were, I don't know, I wouldn't say that they thought were stupid, but they thought that certainly, you know, they were so good at solving things in the internet and creating new new worlds that way that they could just raise them Capital and open a factory and kind of invent a new way of building without really understanding buildings.  So, as it turned out, like companies like Katerra certainly blew it. I mean, my favorite remark from one of the former Katerra executives was they "misunderstood the complexity of field conditions." Which, of course, that's all construction is: one field condition after another.

And so there are a bunch of, there's more and more people coming into the space trying to solve manufactured housing, from multi level big projects in different ways, you know, would be Type V, metal, panel, volumetric, even printing, as I just said, that that is something that sort of ecosystem of entrepreneurship, trying to solve this problem is super exciting. And it's going to yield something we don't know what it is, you know, and so some of these companies only work for themselves, you know, they're developers, also, some are providing third-party boxes. And so the more that we use this ecosystem, the more it's proven. Again, and again, and again, the more widely adopted, it will be.  But right now, I mean, so there's this word, a tipping point where, where a lot of people see the risk of modular doesn't make up for the reward that you might get. But then as a very vocal, strong minority, saying, You're out of your mind, cost construction is going crazy union laborers boxing us in, we have this as the only way out. So I think more and more, we're going to see these, some of these factors will fail. And some of these factors are going to come up with this wonderful delivery method, and push modular forward into other other ways of building that we just haven't seen before. So I'm looking forward to that.

And so there's, there's so many factories that are just popping up, that's the great new thing is people are taking the risk, the business risk, and really going for it.

John McMullen 

So given that there's been so much invention and innovation, all these new ways of building the past few years, what would you say to a designer to an architect who's coming in and discovering modular, wanting to do modular offsite construction, any of the types of construction you've mentioned? What would you say to that person to get them going? What advice would you give?

Ken Lowney 

Oh, god, it's one of those things where work for someone that has done it before. So that's the that's the main thing. There's, there's enough that's different about it, that it's worth going through one on and then you know, it's the the dual permitting. And then the sort of the forward review of construction, even though you're it's everything was so much more accelerated in a different order than construction. So I'd say intern or work for an architect. That's done it before.

John McMullen 

And what's coming up? That's good advice. That's good advice. What's coming up for Lowney Architecture next? What's next for you personally, for your firm? Are you working on anything fun?

Ken Lowney 

Yes, what am I working on now. So modular really opened the door for my firm for hotels. And so it's, we most of the modular work that we do, is multifamily. And it's sort of the bulk of it. But the past, oddly enough, it really accelerated in the pandemic and sort of modular has given us again, this competitive advantage. Hotel developers and and the flags themselves are, of course, interested in saving money and quality. And modular does that in spades. So not all of our hotels end up being modular, but a lot of them do. And that is something that is really exciting and gratifying. And so that that whole market opened up for us because of modular. And so we're very happy about that. I mentioned, we have an office in Honolulu, in Honolulu, and we work in all the islands in the state of Hawaii. And they pretty much have the same market profile and scarcity of resources and, you know, income issues and lack of affordable housing, and they don't really have any modular is just hasn't really even started there.

And so we're starting to talk to builders, who we're actually helping set up a factory right now, for a builder, which is exciting. And we're working on some very large projects, where the client is talking about this is so big, there's like 2000 units is big enough that it might make sense for us to actually build the factory or work with The factory to get, you know, either on the islands or mainland to start thinking thinking and a different way to deliver housing. So that and then, of course, working with the unions to solve that. So that is really exciting.  So the more people that adopt modular, the more people that are willing to, you know, roll sleeves and make it work, the better it's going to be for everyone, you know, and we're not with certainly we're not going to solve our housing crisis. I'm in the United States is like two and a half million. How housing short housing units short, so that's gonna It's so when the idea of manufactured housing is here, and we have to just start to implement it to solve our problems.

John McMullen 

That's a very, very exciting project for you Hawaii, beautiful location. Maybe you can talk to our board of directors about opening an office [for MBI] in Honolulu. I'm sure the MBI staff would not mind.

I know you're busy. Before I let you go, I'd be remiss not to mention our upcoming events. MBI is hosting its next World of Modular next spring in Las Vegas. And we're sponsoring the Offsite Construction Expo in Denver next month. Any chance you're attending either of these?

Ken Lowney 

I'm not only in my attending, but I'm speaking certainly at the Offsite Construction Expo in Denver. We've got our talk proven and I'm hoping to speak of the one in Vegas too.

John McMullen 

Fantastic. Well, I will see you at those, I hope.

Ken Lowney 

Yeah, of course.

John McMullen 

Excellent. Well, Ken, I really appreciate your time today. It's been a pleasure. It's great to talk to you as always. I look forward to seeing you next time, either in Denver or Vegas.

Ken Lowney 

Yeah, absolutely. John, have a great day out there. Enjoy that sunshine.

John McMullen 

I will do my very, very best.  My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Current Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Modular Construction Industry w/ MBI Board Chair Mike Wilmot

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I’m the marketing director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Mike Wilmot, president and co-founder of Wilmot Modular and the current chair of the Modular Building Institute’s board of directors. Mike is here to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the modular construction industry today.

Mike, thanks for being here.

Mike Wilmot

John, I look forward to our really good conversation on where the modular industry is going.

John McMullen 

Well, I've been looking forward to this for a while. So let's dive in. Tell me about yourself and the formation of Wilmot Modular. What was your goal when you started out?

Mike Wilmot

John, I'm the co-founder of Wilmot Modular. We’ve been around for 32 years, our goal was to develop a really strong customer service company in the mid-Atlantic area, very proud of the fact that we grew from a small startup company to a really a strong company that has 3500 accounts and 32 national awards from the MBI. So, we're very proud of where we've gone and where we're going to go.

John McMullen 

And you and your wife, Kathy, had been in the modular relocatable buildings industry for, like you said, 32 years, have you seen things change over that time, I'm sure it must be significant.

Mike Wilmot

Oh, major changes. When we started, what we used to call the “wobbly box” industry has turned into a very high-powered…all kinds of modular construction, being concrete and steel, everything from whole campuses, to retail centers, everything going modular. The evolution has been pretty dramatic, with new and really better ways of building accelerated construction.

John McMullen 

So, you sound like a busy guy, I know this the family business for you, you've got your fingers in everything. Why did you start serving on MBI’s Board of Directors?

Mike Wilmot

I was really passionate about the industry. And I could never give enough back to the industry, what it's given to myself and my family. It really has been a great ride and a great journey through the modular business. I really enjoy working with the MBI. I enjoy helping steer some of the protection that we need to do. And we really look forward to the building industry. But I'm really excited about being involved.

John McMullen 

And you are, as I mentioned, you're the board chair now. What excites you, in particular, about being in that position?

Mike Wilmot

I love working with a group of very talented board of directors of art are, are really the exciting thing I see is growing market share for the industry, and really protecting the industry, from different things that come to us as we get bigger and bigger.

John McMullen 

So, you've got 32 years of experience under your belt, you chair the board of directors of our international trade association—largest in the world…you have a unique vantage point on the industry. I was wondering, from your point of view, what are the some of the biggest challenges facing the modular construction industry today?

Mike Wilmot

I would think our biggest challenge is the acceptance of modular from stick-built. I also believe that the biggest challenge is that we need to continue to get the great work that the modular industry is doing out through public relations. I believe also that one of the big challenges is as we get bigger and bigger, we become target of the federal government. I do believe that Davis-Bacon is a big challenge for our industry. They want to move the Davis-Bacon Act into the factories, which we think is not the right way to move.

John McMullen 

So let's dive into the Davis-Bacon act. A little more. We've done a lot of press on that: we've had a magazine, and a podcast, dedicated to the Davis-Bacon Act. I know you've been working very hard to spread the word about its potential impact. What can you tell me about the act itself and what you've been hearing from MBI members that you've spoken with?

Mike Wilmot

Well, the Department of Labor has taken upon itself to apply Davis-Bacon rates to our offsite factories. Our owners of the factories and our stakeholders believe this is a big mistake. It would create total chaos within the industry to try to separate the standard rates; Davis-Bacon would create a lot of difficulty. It could potentially cause a $2 billion drop in revenue. If we can't solve it, I believe some factories will just say, “No, we're not going to bid it” because of the chaos that it would create. We hopefully can either slow it down or amend it or get rid of it.

John McMullen 

Have you heard anything specific from…I know you are working with several members part of a task force to raise awareness raise some revenue to combat the DBA…Have you heard anything specific from members about how, this will affect their workers in the factories.

Mike Wilmot

Very much so. I think they're concerned that the division of the labor costs would create a lot of problems, not only in reporting it, but implementing it. And I would think that what we want to do as an industry is to stay with what we've done in the past very successfully. And I think as long as we understand that this is not a move in the right direction, I think the factories will be able to go back to the way we've done it and continue to do it right.

John McMullen 

So, we've talked about a couple of challenges facing the industry, not insignificant challenges at that. But let's switch gears for a second: What opportunities do you see for modular construction, both now in the next three to five years?

Mike Wilmot

I think a gigantic opportunity for us as an industry is that we're only 5-10% of the total construction that's out there; I think we can double that in the next five years. I believe there is a great opportunity for the modular industry to be the leader in [net] zero energy. I believe we've developed some studies that can show that modular construction can lead the way with [net] zero energy buildings.

There's also a huge need for migrant worker housing. I think as long as we can keep our costs in line, we can be the leader in affordable housing. I also believe that with the disaster planning, we can be the solution to major disasters, whether it be hurricanes or tornadoes, or anything in solving space problems for the world.

John McMullen 

Well, we've got two of those crises going on right now. Simultaneously, we've got, you know, migrants being flown into other states. New York, I know, has an immediate need for that. And we've got (Hurricane) Ian coming up the coast of Florida. So, a big need, I would think for relocatable buildings is disaster relief, administrative infrastructure, you name it. I know the module industry has a long history of responding to disasters like this. I can't imagine that'll change anytime soon. What's your take?

Mike Wilmot

I think there is a huge opportunity to help the communities out whether it be through modular medical facilities or admin support. When Sandy hit years ago, our industry stepped up and did a wonderful job of supporting the workers, whether it was for the carpenters or the medical facility people, but we personally got involved in that. And it was a very good down deep feeling to see people getting helped by the modular industry. And I think it's going to be a constant—whether it be in Florida, or in New Orleans—that we've got people that can react in our industry, we can rapidly deploy space to help people in these disasters,

John McMullen 

Which only become more difficult if the DBA comes into effect, I would imagine.

Mike Wilmot

Oh, exactly.

John McMullen

So talk to me about the modular building Institute MBI. You're fortunate enough to be the board chair during a couple of notable milestones this year and next MBI just brought on his 500th member, which we're very happy about. And then next year, is the 40th anniversary of the association itself. What's the importance of MBI? And why should more companies consider joining?

Mike Wilmot

There's a just a tremendous need for us to be continuing to learn and grow as an industry. I think we as an association, we create that vehicle for people to learn and to become stronger in the industry. I think our role from the MBI should be to educate and protect. And I think we do an exceptional job of that.

John McMullen 

Do you have any goals still as board chair?

Mike Wilmot

I do. There are several I would like to create a very large war chest to protect the industry, whether it be Davis-Bacon or any other legislative issue that would attack our industry. I'd like to create a million-dollar war chest for us and we're well on our way to doing that.

I'd also like the MBI to do grassroots development with young architects and young people getting into the setup business. And I believe that we can train people up specifically for modular construction. But we definitely need to really attack the millennials and get them involved so that we got a future.

John McMullen 

Well, I think that's a great point. I know. worker shortage is coming up fast. It's here now in many respects. Training and Education for younger workers is really critical, not just for us, but for the trades at large. But yeah, I can't wait to work with you about you know, education and new programs MBI can get to help spread the word and build some enthusiasm about all the opportunities that modular has to offer.

Mike Wilmot

No question.

John McMullen 

Tell me about your experiences at World of Modular, MBI’s big annual trade show. How would you convince someone to attend who never has?

Mike Wilmot

I would tell our listeners that the World of Modular is the conference for modular construction. You're going to be rubbing elbows with the experts throughout our industry, you're going to hear experts really help you build your business and protect your business. We have world renowned speakers coming in, whether it be economist or architects, really is a great forum to learn more about the industry and to make some new contacts. It's a really great way to network with the major decision makers that are out there.

John McMullen 

And as you mentioned, at the top, you can win some awards!

Mike Wilmot

That's right.

John McMullen

What's, what's your favorite thing about the modular construction industry? You've been in 32 years now? Your don't show any sign signs of slowing down? What's your favorite part?

Mike Wilmot

Oh, John, I just love, love the fact that we can create something from nothing. I love the fact that I have taken a clean slate and developing it from nothing into a beautiful building. It's extremely fulfilling to see our customers eyes light up when they see a brand-new building, and it makes them look good. It's something that is very fulfilling. It's what I enjoy the most about what I do.

After 36 years of doing this, I get even more excited these days when I see a new building going in and seeing our customers happiness.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. That's awesome. Thank you, Mike. It's always great to talk to you. I know this is a challenging time for industry. We have a lot going on a lot of needs that we need to meet. But I know we're more than capable. I think you're doing a great job at the helm. I appreciate it and appreciate your time. I can't wait to see you again in that World of Modular in Las Vegas.

Mike Wilmot

Thanks, John. Appreciate it.

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Rebuilding Ukraine: What Modular Manufacturers, Dealers, and Developers Need to Know w/ OFC, Inc

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone, my name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Bruce Talley, Chief Operating Officer at OFC Incorporated. Bruce is here to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, and what modular manufacturers and dealers need to know if they're interested in helping in the relief effort.

Bruce, thanks for being here.

Bruce Talley 

Thanks a lot, John.

John McMullen 

So let's dive right in. Tell me about yourself, Bruce. What's your background with OFC and what piqued your interest in modular and offsite construction?

Bruce Talley 

It's a bit of a story, John. I started out worked in investment banking for a long time, bond issues, loan participations. Then I grew interested in, of all places, Russia. I went to Southern Russia, bought and sold commercial land, and eventually started in and ran what became the largest destination management company in Sochi before the Olympic Games there.  So we employed about 60 people. We did workforce relocation together with financial management of contracts. We did TV studios, offices, warehouses, staffing, translators, transportation systems, laundry, you name it for the Olympic broadcasters, partners, and sponsors that were there for the two- or three-year period before the games. And really, this was my entree into modular building because a real dynamic guy named Michael Pitts approached me in 2012. And he had the idea of providing housing, which was in real short supply in Sochi. Sochi's a very narrow city stuck between the Black Black Sea and the Caucasus Mountains. He had the idea of providing housing solutions to the Organising Committee, what Michael proposed and really, Michael and I proposed to the Organising Committee was using cargo container conversions and/or other modular solutions for the ceremony's folks. They had about 2000 people that they were employing, and there really wasn't a good housing solution. Lots of small off-grid, mini hotels and, and things like that. But in order to put 2000 people in one place where you can house, secure, feed, and then transport them to and from the Olympic Stadium, that was our solution.  Ultimately, the solution didn't didn't pan out with the Organising Committee, they spent an absolute fortune on bringing in several cruise ships.

But it intrigued me the ideas, the usages of modular housing, and especially cargo container conversions in these kinds of situations, disasters, whether it's climate related or conflict, the refugees or internally-displaced people, as a result of conflict, it's clear that modular building is going to be a really important feature all over the world going going forward.

John McMullen 

So you mentioned conflict and the really, there's the one big one in the world that everyone's talking about now, of course, that's the war in Ukraine. You have an extraordinarily broad business background, it's taken you all over the world. But tell me about your connection with Ukraine.

Bruce Talley 

Certainly, living in provincial Russia for about 10 years, I also spent a good deal of time in Ukraine. A lot of the cities that you hear the news I've been to multiple times: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Sevastopel, Mykolaiv, Odesa. So, I know the country very well. I was there for personal reasons, and also investigating opportunities. I spent a lot of time and of course, despite the war, there have always been some cultural similarities between Russia and Ukraine.  So it's an interesting country has some differences. And so, I learned quite a bit about Ukraine during my decade or so in Russia. Since then, since the conflict is started. I've been over there several times for extended periods, to gather information, talk to friends, see what's happening on the ground, and also to take over medical supplies to the Foreign Legion that's been operating there.

John McMullen 

So what have you seen there since the war started? What are the conditions on the ground that you've witnessed?

Bruce Talley 

You know, it's really is varied from region to region in Ukraine. The western part of Ukraine, until last night in Kyiv, particularly, hadn't been hit very hard with shelling I understand that. The Kyiv was again hit last night hadn't been hit too badly. But the further east you go the you know, and of course, south, the more devastating the the destruction, the damage in the in the human human loss and human tragedy spent. Kyiv, the center, had some damage, not a lot at that time or during the times that I was there, I was in Kharkiv. And it was really horrific to see the difference.  Kharkiv was a large city, second largest in the country, lots of young people, there's a number of universities, and very close to the Russian border. So it was shelled at the time that I was there, shelled before shelled after. And I went through a region called Saltivka. And I've been there multiple times, you know, 10 years, eight years, 12 years ago, and this region had lot has large apartment blocks, some of them several blocks long. And I'm thinking of an area specifically that was maybe a mile and a half long, six 800 yards wide, and had dozens of these very large apartment buildings with hundreds and hundreds of apartments in each one. Each of these buildings sustained enough damage to render it. In total uninhabitable there are some individual apartments that people can live in, there's a couple of percent of people that probably still are, are living their age and people that don't have other alternatives.

But around there, in Saltivka, you saw the smaller kind of neighborhood grocery stores also been shelled, shot out, these are maybe 800 to 2000-3000 square feet. And then the large market which is too far away, large outdoor market suffered a great deal of damage the center with where all fruits and vegetables, dairy products are sold, badly damaged. And literally hundreds and hundreds of metal kiosks around selling everything from tennis shoes to, you know, batteries, all very badly damaged. And I know that your listeners have probably seen video and pictures there. But it's absolutely the case, they've done a great job of representing the damage. And, of course, in some of the smaller cities that were occupied by separatists, and by the Russian military, you know, some of those are just completely devastated.

John McMullen 

So with with all the damage that you've just recounted within in all different types of, of buildings, living/multifamily buildings, markets, storefronts, what's the best solution to get structures in place, you know, now or in the short term? Are there different types of solutions that you're thinking about might work? Or is would one be better than the other? What do you think?

Bruce Talley

Well, I think it's going to depend somewhat on preferences. You know, you have in Ukraine, some of the power has been devolved from the central government to municipalities. That's always been an issue in that part of the world. And the inclination, I think, now is that mayors don't want to necessarily hand that back. So, that decentralization does allow for a more case-by-case solution, which I think is always better, right? And I think that you're going to have different problems in different cities. And I think you're going to have different solutions that are going to work, I think you're going to have a little different perspective. Several of the cities in the West, I've had conversations with extensive conversations with about what the recovery might look like. Are they building temporary? Are they building permanent? So I don't think there's going to be a one size fits all for any of these.

I think that some of the cities are going to opt for relatively inexpensive, temporary accommodations that can ultimately be moved, repurposed, sold. Some of them are talking about solutions that may be more permanent but still can be rapidly constructed, you know, other kinds of modular solutions.  So I'm sorry if I've been sort of vague there, but I don't see a perfect answer that encapsulates how it's going to happen. I will say that housing has got to be a key part of it, because in the small towns, you'll see a lot of these homes had been, they may be single family homes, relatively small in size, but they may have been occupied by Russian soldiers and completely trashed.

The apartment buildings, and they'll have those these large apartment blocks, even in a relatively small city of, you know, 10 or 20,000 people, you'll have some of these areas that are comprised mostly of fairly large apartment buildings. A lot of those have been damaged in the small cities and of course in the larger cities.  So it's going to be I think housing is going to be necessary. We can look at opportunities in schools. Many of these large apartment buildings will have a preschool on the on the bottom floor. So those have been badly damaged. And I think that, you know, I look at cargo container conversions for some of the some of the stores and some of the kiosks around the markets, I think those can be an excellent, quick solution.

John McMullen 

So you mentioned earlier the decentralization of power I could see that certainly being a challenge to getting different types of buildings into different places and get relief where it needs to go. I was wondering if you could speak to that just for a second, and perhaps also about what other challenges there may be to getting modular or container base buildings built in Ukraine now.

Bruce Talley 

Yeah, it's a great question, John. Logistics are going to be, and currently are, a big issue. Right now, there are long lines across the border into Ukraine from Poland, which is really become the primary point for, you know, goods that have been been shipped in. So that's, that's going to be a big issue. How do you get materials in? And of course workforce. I think that's going to drive a lot of this. The mayor's are very sensitive to the idea that, look, there folks have been out of country, in some cases, for more than six months have they begun to rebuild a life in Poland, or the Netherlands, or Germany, or Romania, or someplace else. And so what will bring people back and it's this prospect of employment. So I think that's something that's really driving a conversation in Kyiv. But also, on the, as you say, on the municipal level. And outside of Kyiv, there's a strong possibility of a development park being put in and we're looking to participate there. This development park would allow companies to bring in products and goods and show what they can do.

John McMullen 

What about financing? How would that be handled?

Bruce Talley 

Well, I think that's really going to drive everything. There's been the beginnings of conversations about this, and some very well placed people with the German Marshall Fund had been talking about it. And that the thinking is, I think, right now, since the United States has taken the lead on providing the military equipment, the ammunition, artillery, all this, that probably European Union will have a bigger stake in the in the rebuilding effort. So there'll be a lot of American money, there'll be a lot of European money. There'll be British, I suppose, Canadian, Japanese and other participants as well. But it looks to me like there, there will be a tremendous amount of money, there's probably going to be a serious look at systemic reforms in Ukraine so that investors or donors from from these large economies can be relatively confident that the money's not going to disappear. So there's there probably will be be systemic reforms, there will probably be some looking at building codes, those kinds of things to make sure that they're, you know, in line with European standards.  And so I think that's where the money will come from.

My personal opinion is that American companies and Canadian companies as well, European companies, are going to have a real advantage because these are the economies, these are the governments, these are the people that have been very supportive of Ukrainian war effort. And I can tell you, John, that in traveling around in Poland, and especially Ukraine, I don't think I've ever been any place in my lifetime, and I've traveled to more than 60 countries, I don't think I've been any place that is as pro-American as, as I say, as Poland, and especially, especially Ukraine are right now, people would hear my American accent, and give me free rides.

John McMullen 

Wow.

Bruce Talley 

And this is in a place where fuel has gotten very, very expensive because of the war.

John McMullen 

I would imagine.

So obviously, I mean, the war is ongoing. A lot of things are up in the air, in terms of, you know, logistics, financing, everything. But let's say the war ends tomorrow. You've talked about the immediate needs for housing, for some social infrastructure. But let's let's look at the next three to five years. How do you think that's going to look in terms of rebuilding?

Bruce Talley 

That's a little bit of a difficult question for me to answer because there are so many unknown unknowns here. It's, it's going to be hard. I mean, the different times in this process of Again, to feel a little more optimistic that, you know, the Russian military may collapse and this thing could end quicker than we think. And then, and of course, this isn't based upon my feelings. Clearly, there's going to be a great deal of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt around the country, you know, bridges, train stations, hospitals, these are absolutely critical. And and I'm not sure anybody's gotten their arms around exactly how bad the situation is. And then I think you have to think about housing and employment.  So what it looks like I don't know, I know that some of the people are talking about an American "recovery coordinator" because of US/American credibility and prestige may be important in in pulling all this together. There's talk that there may be some form of war insurance. So if you're going in directly with your people, with your your plant with your operations, perhaps there's a way that that can be secured so that you're not taking quite as big a risk and in an area that's seen, you know, the worst conflict Europe has had since 1945.

John McMullen 

So I've been following on LinkedIn for a while there are a few manufacturers that are up and running and manufacturing in Ukraine right now. But let's say you're based in America, or Canada or Europe, what would a modular manufacturer or developer need to know to get started?

Bruce Talley 

You know, clearly, you've got to think about transporting supplies about your location about the legal environment on the ground, there are a lot of things to consider. Are you bringing your employees in? What does that look like in terms of employment law in Ukraine? A lot of issues if a company wants to do that. I think they should contact me. We have legal resources. We have cultural understanding. We speak Russian. Some of our associates clearly speak Ukrainian as well. So I think that the short answer is contact us or contact me.  But in the long run, there's a there's a pretty good learning curve there. I think a lot of what's going to happen is going to go through Poland in one form or another. So that's a that's going to be I believe a jumping off point. And clearly Warsaw is going to be an important city for the near future.

John McMullen 

Whenever there's a good modular community in Poland that are members of MBI. So hopefully, that can serve as a little touch point for people in the industry looking to connect both you and the greater industry going into Ukraine. Bruce, I really appreciate your time today. I don't know if you have anything else that you feel that manufacturers or developers need to know, in order to, you know, stay engaged and get involved...

Bruce Talley 

Yeah, thanks, John, I believe that there's a big opportunity for modular builders to take part to add value in Ukraine to help ease suffering and to make some money. I mean, that's the point of drive this. And this, I'm sure this will be the largest reconstruction effort maybe in the world since 1945. And then in dollar terms, you know, it's it's really going to be massive, the estimates range from multiple hundreds of billions of dollars on. So I think there's an opportunity there.

John McMullen 

So I think, you know, definitely is there's a lot a lot of buildings to build a lot of people to help. So I'm sorry we're here. I wish we were not. But in terms of, you know, opportunities for the industry, this certainly is one. And I hope that, speaking for the industry, I hope that we can be of all the assistance we can be.

Bruce Talley 

You know, I wanted to add one more thing, John. When we're talking about getting involved in Ukraine, there is a steep learning curve, there are cultural and legal barriers that will be new to it, especially to North American companies. So it's possible. But if a manufacturer a builder wants to acquire our abilities, our knowledge, our culture, cultural understanding and language skills, and ability to bridge that gap, you know, I think we can we can do that very well.

John McMullen 

Excellent, excellent. I appreciate it, Bruce. And you are with OFC Incorporated, what's your website and how do people get in contact with you?

Bruce Talley 

OFCI.com. And I can be reached at bt@ofci.com. And that's in case it wasn't clear. That's an O as in Oscar, F as in Frank, C as in Charlie, I as in India .com.

John McMullen 

Awesome. Thank you, Bruce. Again, I really appreciate your time today. Very important information. I hope eventually things will turn around and we can get people the help that they need.

Bruce Talley 

Yeah, it's hard not to cover one's eyes when you see all the suffering.

John McMullen 

All right, Bruce, thank you so much.

Sure. About 12 or 13 years ago, I was a low-rung engineer in California, and I met a young lady who said that China is the future. I ventured over to China, and while that relationship didn't last, the business did. I started Stack Modular, and we primarily operate in Canada and Asia.

[John]
That's quite a journey. Now, you mentioned that Stack Modular builds with steel. Why is that?

[Jim]
We've always found steel to be a suitable material for our modular buildings. In China, we didn't have an abundance of timber or wood, so steel was the natural choice. Additionally, steel offers several advantages, including durability, high seismic resistance, design flexibility, fire resistance, and less warping and mold issues compared to wood. Steel is also better suited for transportation over long distances, which is important for us, given our operations between China and North America.

[John]
It makes sense. Steel certainly has its advantages. What's the main difference between steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular construction? Are there other differences beyond the ones you've mentioned?

[Jim]
Certainly. While steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular share many similarities, there are some key differences. Steel-frame modular buildings are typically designed for greater heights than wood-frame structures. They offer more design flexibility because steel has a higher strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for less structural intrusion into room layouts. Steel is fire-resistant, making it a safer choice in terms of fire protection. Steel modules are also less susceptible to warping and mold issues, which can be problematic with wood. Additionally, steel-frame modular buildings tend to be more durable and have a longer lifespan.

[John]
Those are some significant advantages. Now, you recently worked on a project in California that combined steel-frame modules with site-built components. Can you tell us more about that project and how it worked?

[Jim]
Certainly. In California, we're working on a hybrid project that combines steel-frame modular units with site-built components. In this project, the first three stories of the building are site-built using concrete construction. Above those three levels, we stack the steel-frame modular units. This approach allows us to take advantage of the speed and efficiency of modular construction while accommodating specific site requirements and building needs.

[John]
That sounds like an interesting approach. What's the installation process like for a project like this, where you have a combination of site-built and modular components? Are there any special considerations?

[Jim]
The installation process for a hybrid project like this involves several steps. First, the site-built components, such as the concrete foundation and the first three stories of the building, are constructed on-site. Simultaneously, in our factory, we build the steel-frame modular units that will be stacked on top of the site-built portion.

Once the modules are complete and have passed quality checks, they are transported to the project site. The modules are then lifted into place by cranes and stacked on top of the site-built structure. On-site, the teams work on connecting MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) systems vertically, tying them into the corridor system. The corridors and finishing work are typically completed on-site.

The key to a successful project like this is coordination between the various teams, including architects, engineers, the modular provider, and the construction crew. Communication and alignment between all parties are critical to ensure that the modules align seamlessly with the site-built components.

[John]
I can imagine that coordination is essential for a project like this. Speaking of coordination, how does the design process work for a hybrid modular project? Are there any special considerations for architects and engineers?

[Jim]
The design process for a hybrid modular project begins with early collaboration between the modular provider, architects, engineers, and the project's ownership group. It's crucial to involve the modular team from the early sketch stages of the project to ensure that the design accommodates modular construction efficiently.

Architects and engineers need to keep modular construction principles in mind while designing the building. This includes understanding module dimensions, structural considerations, and the need for vertical and horizontal connections between modules. Open-mindedness and a willingness to adapt to modular design principles are essential for a successful project.

Ultimately, the goal is to design with modular construction in mind, optimizing the benefits of both site-built and modular components.

[John]
That makes sense. Are there any special considerations or challenges for the on-site team when working with a hybrid modular project like this?

[Jim]
Yes, there can be challenges for the on-site team when working on a hybrid modular project. One significant consideration is the coordination between the on-site construction crew and the modular provider. Both teams need to work together seamlessly to ensure that the modules fit precisely onto the site-built components.

There may also be differences in the finishing work required for the site-built and modular portions of the building. While modular units are typically 98% complete in terms of interior finishes, some finishing work is still needed on-site, especially in common areas like corridors.

In general, the on-site team needs to adapt to the unique requirements of a hybrid modular project, ensuring that all components align correctly and that MEP systems are integrated smoothly.

[John]
I can see how that coordination and adaptation are essential for a successful project. Do you see hybrid structures like this becoming more common as modular construction gains popularity?

[Jim]
Absolutely. Hybrid structures offer a practical solution for many construction projects. While modular construction is known for its speed and efficiency, there will always be site-specific requirements and design considerations that are best addressed through traditional site-built construction. Hybrid modular projects allow for the best of both worlds, combining the benefits of modular and site-built components. As modular construction continues to gain popularity, we can expect to see more hybrid projects that leverage the strengths of both approaches.

[John]
That's a great perspective. So, what's next for Stack Modular? Do you have any exciting projects or developments on the horizon?

[Jim]
Our focus is on continuing to deliver high-quality modular solutions while adapting to changing circumstances. One of our primary challenges right now is navigating the complexities of international trade and regulations, especially between China and North America. We want to ensure that our clients are protected and that we can continue to provide efficient modular solutions for housing and building needs.

As for exciting projects, who knows what the future holds? We're always looking for opportunities to push the boundaries of modular construction. We could see ourselves working

 on even taller and more complex projects in the coming years, including potentially 40 or 50-story structures right here in North America.

[John]
That's ambitious and exciting. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Stack Modular. Thanks so much for joining us today, Jim. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.

[Jim]
Thank you, John. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to a future with exciting modular projects.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time!Notes From a Growing Manufacturer: New Projects and Lessons Learned w/ FullStack Modular

John McMullen 

Welcome everyone. My name is John McMullen. And I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Roger Krulak, founder of FullStack Modular, Roger is here to share some exciting news about a new modular project, and talk about the growth and development of FullStack itself.

Roger, thanks for being here.

Roger Krulak 

Thanks, John. How are you today?

John McMullen 

I am wonderful, sir. How are you?

Roger Krulak 

Very good. Thanks.

John McMullen 

So tell me about yourself, Roger. How did you get your start in the modular construction industry?

Roger Krulak 

Well, I grew up in the construction and development industry and spent most of my life in construction. I was always frustrated with the level of inefficiency and wasted time, money, space. And in around 2007, I was lucky enough to get some money to do an R&D project to figure out how to build high rise modular buildings. And that led to the creation of the company that is now FullStack Modular.

John McMullen 

Very good. Very good. So what what was your goal for the company when it started, and how was that goal changed over time?

Roger Krulak 

The goal for the company was first to prove that you could build high-rise modules efficiently, which we did quite quite effectively. And also the goal was... I grew up in the construction and development world and in the development world, obviously, returns matters. Time matters. And in New York, where I was located, the volatility of the construction market made it really hard to predict whether the investments that you were making were going to yield or not yield, given the cost of construction and land. And so that unpredictability was a push towards trying to find some way to be more efficient. And also, part of the goal of the company at the time was to build affordable, attainable housing. And that even more so requires, you know, predictable costs, predictable timeframe.

John McMullen 

So you said you started FullStack with trying to prove that a high-rise modular building could work and it did. And you mentioned, attainable housing. Can you tell me about any bumps that you may have encountered in your early days? And what did you learn from those?

Roger Krulak 

Sure. Well, first of all I was working at for city at the time, FullStack Modular store was an outgrowth of, of my time there. And the bumps in the road, I think still exist, although they've, they've gotten a little less a little smoother, a little bit lower. So the bumps in the road are, you know, they were more regulation than anything at the time. And the ability of the construction and willingness of the construction industry as a whole to accept the idea of volumetric modular solution, or industrialized construction is a solution. That's, that's dissipated significantly. And of course, the next hurdle was financing. Again, that is diminished, diminishing significantly, it's still, it's still a challenge, but not near the challenge. So now, now, you're left with the major challenge, which is a paradigm shift of process.

So this country has always been, well, since I was a little kid (and I'm old!), has always been a design-bid-build process, which is hugely inefficient, and also doesn't lend itself at all to modular or industrialized construction, because you want to be involved at the beginning and the design in the outset. So that, to me is the biggest hurdle. And that's you're just starting to see that ship turn, both publicly and privately to sort of a more design-build process or a design-manufacture-construct process. So that that's the biggest hurdle.

Everything else has gone pretty smoothly, you know that the one big problem I think that modular companies or manufacturers face as a whole right now is that you have to figure out how to how to actually get the cost of the onsite work to match the quantity or percentage of onsite work. That seems to be where the value proposition of modular gets lost most today.

John McMullen 

So tell me about how FullStack has grown since those early days since your early projects. I heard you're working on a new factory in Oregon.

Roger Krulak 

We do we have we have located on in the Pacific Northwest, on Swan island with with one of our major steel manufacturers, and we're building our first project that out there for Starwood Capital Group in Sunnyvale, California. And, and yeah, we're working with another company to productize student housing in the Berkeley area and I could go on for hours but it's a very exciting time for the growth of FullStack Modular countrywide.

John McMullen 

That's awesome. So tell me about the factory, how was it different from your existing one? And what lessons have you learned and apply to design of this factory that you may have picked up over the years?

Roger Krulak 

So since we've co-located I've been, we've learned a lot about the way, let me step back a sec. So FullStack has always been focused on the idea of industrializing the process of construction. So the one thing that always frustrated me is the process of construction and organizing it by trades is inefficient. And if you're going to manufacture, you need to look at everything in a different way. In other words, you need to look at everything in a process of assemblies and sub-assemblies. So doing that you have to think about the way you're producing or the way that you're manufacturing in order to optimize for that. And so we've always been focused on that. However, learning how to do that, or organizing that is a task because the industry as a whole is not organized that way.

John McMullen 

So you mentioned, you mentioned Sunnyvale earlier, the project you have going in there is a Treehouse Hotel. Tell me about this project.

Roger Krulak 

So it's a very exciting project for FullStack Modular. We've been collaborating with Starwood Capital Group to launch their Treehouse hotel brand, which is part of the One hotel brand in the United States. So it's gonna be the first Treehouse in the United States. And it's a six storey seismically-responsive flag for Starwood Capital Group that is supposed to remind you of being in a treehouse as a child, it's playful.

John McMullen 

Tell me about seismically responsive modular buildings, I'm sure there's an entire science behind it. If you could dumb it down for me, how does that how does that work?

Roger Krulak 

So the one thing about FullStack Modular's process is we are an all-steel solution. It's an all-steel bolt together solution. And, and, and it was originally designed, you know, for here in the on the East Coast, which the forces here are wind and snow. And so as you move to the areas that have seismic activity or in a different category seismically, the building needs to respond to that and you need to create shear walls and drag the seismic forces back to those shear walls in order to pick those up. The interesting thing about our system is that it's very adaptable to that process. So literally, we can add a steel brace frame and some drag beams on top of our mods and our system is exactly as it is here on the East Coast with with a few simple additions in order to incorporate it. And we have found that our system, because it's all steel, all one structurally-, mechanically-, electrically-, plumbing-focused solution, it adapts very well, quite easily.

John McMullen 

Nice, very cool. Tell me about the predevelopment for this project. What was your first step? And what how did you incorporate all of these seismically responsive elements?

Roger Krulak 

Yeah, well, I mean, you know, everybody can put a seismic response in oftentimes, it's a concrete shear wall, and then you have to figure out how to drag the mods back to the concrete shear wall. We responded to an RFP, I know start with a tremendous amount of research for different modular companies. And and we ended up being successful in that and then entered into it, you know, a minute Well, you know, we call a modular blueprint agreement or a modular design agreement, where we were designed as to the architect and and created a building that met the needs of Starwood and California State and and Sunnyvale city, and the architects intentions and still utilizing in the Full Stack Modular volumetric system.

John McMullen 

And I heard another MBI members synergy modular was also involved. Can you tell me about what you were both bringing to the table?

Roger Krulak 

Yeah, so Synergy and FullStack are collaborating on several projects. Actually, in addition, our BIM modeling process and production drawing creation is also in collaboration with another MBI member, which is, which is Rebel and iQ in Poland.

John McMullen 

Oh, very good. Yep. So what's unique about this hotel, what drew you to submit a response to that RFP in the first place?

Roger Krulak 

Look, I mean, we for our solution, you know, sort of mid to high rise multifamily. You know, hotels, student housing is always up our alley and hotels, if done right, in my opinion, are generally very repetitive. So and Starwood is a incredibly strong player in the market and and so, you know, they're looking to, you know, be sustainable be repetitive. They're hoping to roll this brand out all across the country. So, collectively, we feel that this is a great prototype for them, that we can that we can rinse and repeat all over the country.

John McMullen 

And when do you when are you looking to complete this project when you think the hotel will open?

Roger Krulak 

At the end of 23.

John McMullen 

Okay, very good.

So given all your experiences, from the East Coast to the West Coast, building all types of buildings, what can up and coming modular manufacturers learn from FullStack?

Roger Krulak 

Well, I think one of the most important things is that you choose a process and a product that you understand and that you can do efficiently, intelligently, productively and with success. So in, you know, in the tech industry, they call that the MVP, I think the minimum valuable product. So I would suggest that anybody tried to get into the industry picks a horse and ride it, as they say, and do it well, because every success in modular gets a little bit of attention, and every failure gets tons of attention. And and we as an industry really can't afford anymore.

John McMullen 

So what's next for FullStack? I saw on LinkedIn that you're partnering with a company in the Middle East developing a bunch of stuff over there. Are you allowed to say anything about that?

Roger Krulak 

Yeah, I mean, we are in very advanced discussions about providing some hotels for the for the Saudi expansion of development and creation of placemaking all throughout Saudi Arabia. So we are in discussions for first manufacturing some product here and shipping it there. And then the goal in Saudi Arabia right now is to create its own modular industry.

John McMullen 

Awesome. I know there's just an explosion of stuff happening over there. So it's exciting that you guys are involved. I, I hope you'll keep us all updated as hopefully those discussions come to some fruition.

Roger Krulak 

Absolutely exciting. I was just I was in Saudi Arabia last week. It's a it's a long trip, but it's super exciting the amount of effort and thoughtfulness they're putting into the idea of of incorporating modern methods of construction in the way that they create these new developments.

John McMullen 

Well, your world travels have queued up my next question. Can we count on seeing you at the World of Modular in Las Vegas in 2023?

Roger Krulak 

Absolutely. Come visit us. We've got we've got a full design-manufacture-construct solution that we will be that we will be showcasing. So we're looking forward to seeing you there.

John McMullen 

Fantastic. Fantastic. Roger. Thank you. I really appreciate your time. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more for FullStack in 23. And I can't wait to see you in Las Vegas.

Roger Krulak 

Thanks, John. Appreciate it.

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Cristian Ossa, commercial manager for Tecno Fast. Cristian is here to talk about Tecno Fast's long history of workforce housing projects, and share some insights about Tecno Fast's success.

Cristian, thanks for being here.

Cristian Ossa 

Hi, John. Thank you. Thank you for letting us introduce Techo Fast to to everyone.

John McMullen 

Absolutely, absolutely. So tell me about yourself, Cristian. What's your background? And how did you come to be a Tecno Fast?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, I'm a commercial engineer. It's a kind of Business and Administration. I started working at Tecno Brazil. It's related company from Tecno Fasts. And in 2010, I started working here at Tecno Fast as deputy commercial manager. And right now I'm the commercial manager. I'm in charge of developing projects and managing the industrial fleet.

John McMullen 

Very good. Very good. So tell me about Tecno Fast itself. Where did the company start? And how's it grown over the years?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, it's a, it's a long trip. Tecno Fast was born in 1995. And the first project was a hotel. And also we built the workforce camp. Then, in 1998, we arrived to Peru. In 2001, we won our first MBI award for the hotel that we did. In 2010, we start with the leasing business business area. Well, in 2015, we start with our own hotel division. And in 2017, we built the tallest modular building in South America for Anglo American; it was a six-story building, under heavy site conditions, with a lot of snow. And then in 2019, we automated our production plant plant. And also we are generating the 80% of the energy that we use to fabricate models, here in the plant.

John McMullen 

That is quite a bit of growth indeed. So what's the size of your rental fleet now? How many beds can you offer at a time?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, if talking about the holding all the companies that are related to Tecno Fast, we have almost 450,000 square meters in the lease fleet. Eighty percent of them are for commercial feet or offices and that kind of solutions. And the other 20 20% is for our workforce housing feet. It's about 10,000 beds that we have in six or seven projects, different projects.

John McMullen 

Wow. So let's talk about workforce housing itself. How would you define workforce housing?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, first of all is important. It's a solution that is focused on the people that use these facilities. Because they spend a lot of time in there. So we focus on the solutions; they have to be comfortable. We go and allow them to have a good rest. Generally, the site conditions are very tough. So we have to develop solutions that fix up with their needs. Like, well, they are far away from home. So we have to give them the best conditions, the most important thing.

John McMullen 

So what can you tell me about the modular workforce housing projects in South America right now? How are these buildings being designed and how are they being built so that their occupants are as comfortable as they can be?

Cristian Ossa 

Okay, well, we have made a lot of workforce housing camps in Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina. And what they have in common is that they are in remote places for certain times. So I think leasing their camps is a good solution for our clients. But in the other hand, we have project with different site conditions, and we have to develop them with the specialty care [based on where they are]. So every camp is a custom solution. And engineering is very important for that.

John McMullen 

Does Tecno Fast provide workforce housing for all types of work sites? Or is there a niche that you specialize in?

Cristian Ossa 

And most of projects are for mining and energy industries. Okay? This is because their their products are from far away from villages or towns. So, it fits very well for them. And of course, we have different standards. For example, we have rules with common bathrooms in the center of the building, we have rooms sharing a bathroom. And also we have private rooms with private bathrooms, it depends of what the clients need. And generally, these are [all-in-one] solutions with water tanks with sewage plants, generators, and all that things.

John McMullen 

So you're bringing in all of these materials, the water tanks, the sewage system, everything?

Cristian Ossa 

Yeah, yeah. And we have to plug all the all the buildings to these solutions we have all the utilities because they need a solution, not only a building.

John McMullen 

How long does it take to set up one of these camps? Typically, I guess it depends on the size. But do you have an average?

Cristian Ossa 

The size of course it's important.  Five or six months for 500 man camp is the average.

John McMullen 

Okay. I know Tecno Fast is won a lot of awards from MBI for its relocatable workforce housing projects. And most recently, I think it was last year for the Escondida Camp 7000 project. Tell me more about about that particular project. How long did it take to get those buildings up and running?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, well, that project was a big challenge, because we replaced buildings that were removed before. So we, we designed the project thinking how to reuse the foundations that were onsite, the connections that were onsite. Also, we we designed the camp in the COVID situation, so people have to sleep in personnel bedrooms, of course. That challenged us because we have different types of bedrooms and and we have to develop the specific one for them. So we had to ooptimize the model, of course, following all the regulations that are used to decide these camps. Well, for example, we decide this model that two models can go in one track. So we have fried cost efficient in terms of timings where we installed the 324 models in four months onsite.

John McMullen 

Wow. Did the terrain give you any particular challenges on that project?

Cristian Ossa 

Yeah. This was like a lesson for is was in between camp that was in use. So we have to build this without interfering with the operation of the camp. So that was a very, very big challenge.

John McMullen 

Are you entering any projects and MBI's Awards of Distinction this year?

Cristian Ossa 

Yeah, we are presenting seven projects, I think. So a couple of them's are related to workforce workforce housing solution. One of them is Rahu Iike project. It's about 1200 people in Cabo also in that case, we are operating the camp. So we are given the whole service building and operated the come to Glencoe is the is the client and the challenge there was permits. There was a very big hard work to to get them and also in terms of size, this cap is almost 15 pounds 50,000 square meter.

John McMullen 

Wow.

Cristian Ossa 

And the other project that is related for work for housing solution is Rincon. It's a little project in Argentina. This is the first stage of a big one. In four month we have to build 250-man camp the challenge here was the logistics because we were sending models from Chile and Argentina and all that it's related to that and we're in a very tight schedule, customs, import and export requirements, etc.

John McMullen 

You brought up something I actually wanted to ask you about: logistics. It seems to me that these massive camps that you guys are building must take just an incredible amount of logistical thought. How do you arrange all the trucks, the manpower, just to get the buildings from A to B?

Cristian Ossa 

Yeah, we have we have a pool of sub contracts, or they gave us that service. But yeah, like you said before, it's it's very heavy, the logistics and organization and coordination, because the models leave the our industry, leave our plant and they have to go outside and at this at the time at the moment that we are assembling, so you have to coordinate everything.

John McMullen 

Is there a typical distance that your units travel between where they start and where they ended up at a camp?

Cristian Ossa 

Distance? Well, for example, in Chile, the main projects are the north of Chile, the north of Chile. So we have almost 2000s kilometres from our plan to the site. And there's three or four days of truck. So it's it's very important to coordinate that.

John McMullen 

So tell me about some of the other challenges that techno fast is facing its workforce housing projects. Are other common problems that need to be solved, you think, or is each case sort of unique?

Cristian Ossa 

No, there are common problems for well, logistically, you already know, it's a big challenge. Also, the These camps are in remote sites. So you are far away from civilization something. So you have to build these camps, looking where you're going to feed your crew or that we're going to...everything is far. That's why, for example, some clients ask us to operate the solution because we're in the early early early stage of a project. So they needed a solution, not only the buildings, they knew the whole solution, and they asked us to operate it.

John McMullen 

How do you guys provide power? Is it generators that you bring in? Or Are you tapping into some other source?

Cristian Ossa 

Yeah. Mostly generators. Because, like I said before, when we arrive to site is there's nothing so the only way to start is with generators.

John McMullen 

Just an amazing undertaking, it seems to me to create a town essentially for hundreds or 1000s of workers out of nothing. Yeah. So switch tracks for you, just for a second. What can you tell me about Tecno Fast's recent acquisitions? I know you the company acquired Triumph Modular here in the States. What's the goal for Tecno Fast: global domination or something else?

Cristian Ossa 

Well, yeah, well, we like is that we are we recently? We have recent acquisition in US and Europe also. Okay. We have Triumpg in the US and ALCO in Barcelona, Spain. Well, this is a kind of strategy to, of course, for growth, the company. And also we're looking for options to get in these mature markets, develop our solutions, could be the rental of the leasing solutions and the sale solutions. I think they are good platforms to get it those countries or start developing them.

John McMullen 

Very good, very good. Well, speaking of being in different parts of the world are you are Tecno Fast going to be at the World of Modular conference in March next year?

Cristian Ossa 

Yes, of course, I'm looking forward to that to the convention. I think it's a really good instance to meet each other and learn a little bit more about some experience of the other companies, projects. And also it's important to know what is going on in terms of innovation or modular solutions. So I think I will be there.

John McMullen 

Well, excellent. I look forward to seeing you there. You could probably teach your own session on logistics. I have a hunch that there's a lot more that goes into it then perhaps you're even alluding to it. It's mind boggling to me. But thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Cristian. I look forward to meeting you in March. And thanks again.

Cristian Ossa 

Thank you, John. Thank you very much. See you.

John McMullen 

Hello, and welcome to Inside Modular, The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Julian Bowron, Founder and Chief Technology Officer at METALOQ. Julian is here to talk about the art and science of modular construction innovation, and to tee us up for his upcoming presentation at the 2023 World of Modular.

Julian, thanks for being here.

Julian Bowron
Thank you, it's a pleasure.

John McMullen 

Tell me about yourself, Julian. What's your background?

Julian Bowron
Well, many years ago, back in the late 70s, I studied industrial design, and in fact, started a career as a as a sculptor, and an artist and then rapidly moved back to my roots, which really lay in tool and die making, which is what I trained for and in high school and trade school. And then you don't have a really, it's just been kind of a logical ramp up in a way. I started off in industrial prototyping at the very beginning. Working on actually systems furniture, in many cases, did a certain amount of work in, in trade shows, and you know, quite a bit of product development work everything from, you know, hospital beds, to defense related equipment, like border security and surveillance stuff. And then, really, through the 2000s, we started execute some lots of large scale, offsite fabricated architectural projects. And that work took us to, you know, China and the Middle East, and extensive work actually on the island of Manhattan, and across the United States and Canada. And, and then by by 2010, I was running a full tilt volumetric modular business. It was actually called the future Walters, prefabricated architectural division, which, yeah, we it was, so we shortened it to FY Wattpad. And, and, in fact, I just was working with that group, again for the last year and a half, helping them again with with detailing and of their various projects. And then out of that came, you know, the whole experience with vector block, and then the most recent incarnation, METALOQ. So that's, that's really the story. It's been a, you know, you could say it's the transition from, really, you could say, 2D to 3D panelization, and off site construction, and then all the way to full volumetric. So kind of a logical progression.

John McMullen 

So, you mentioned I think, was back in the 2000s, you started in the offsite industry? How did you discover offsite and modular construction? Was that something you were introduced to professionally? Or did you know about it personally beforehand?

Julian Bowron
You know, is it Charlie Daniels? The the violin story guy? I was visited by a devil one night, and he did a deal with me.

Now, the reality is that by around 2000, I have to say, I'd had enough experience in the conventional construction industry. And this is in again, in jobs in New York City on luxury hotels, and work, you know, in a wide range of situations that I just really saw, as many have seen how defective the whole process is, how adversarial how poorly planned how the drawings that came that were provided to us, really, in many cases, didn't represent a buildable reality. And I just was really strong, strongly believed that there was a better way to do it. And, and so it really got started when we started using 3d modeling software.

So I'm in 2001, we got our first SolidWorks seat and, and we're actually using 3d AutoCAD as well. And as soon as we were able to design something, and then issue it straight to, you know, waterjet cutting equipment and lasers, and routers, and so on, and then have those parts just slot together very perfectly, you know, that it wasn't lost on any of us. And we had, you know, approximately 100 employees at the time, that this was vastly superior to, you know, cutting and fitting, and that we could create large sub-assemblies that could be shipped complete to sites and assemble successfully with other large sub-assemblies to create the finished product. So and really, I would say that customers drove in a lot. You know, we, we work for a lot of the big design and architecture firms, Gensler, most noteworthy among them, you know, the quality of our delivery, the speed of our delivery, the precision of our delivery, which was, you know, due to these improved working methods, caught people's eye and we just really honestly never looked back from that point. We just got a string of really, really great jobs.

John McMullen 

You’re often billed as an inventor, which I think is very cool. Tell me about inventing. That seems very complex to me. What inspires you to say, “Aha, this thing needs inventing”? What sparks that a little bit of creativity in you?

Julian Bowron
Well, so there's an element of formal training there. So, you know, my library at home is stuffed full of books on design, and especially on industrial design. And what you're taught in industrial design is to analyze a problem, create a problem definition, and go through a substantially formal process to arrive at a solution. And in the conventional construction world, there really was no room for that, you know, you're handed this, these drawings, and you're said, you know, try to make this, the reverse is your hand at a problem, and you're asked to solve it.

And so, I found that as soon as we focused on the design process, that it really freed us up to become problem solvers. And then, with, with supportive clients, I gotta say, the Walters group was one of them, you know, a company working for the US Department of Defense was another, and so on, we were able to develop the design to a very high degree of completion, such that you can then apply for a patent, you know, where the where the solution is really unique, you can apply for a patent. And, and if it truly is unique, you obtain a patent. And so I would say that the transition to inventor from just some somebody that was simply solving, you know, quotidian, day to day problems, came through our adoption of these sophisticated design processes and clients who were willing to support us to a high degree of design completion, that justified patenting the result.

John McMullen 

Got it. You mentioned the formal process that you go through to sort of identify a problem and create a solution? Are there steps within that that you follow rigorously?

Julian Bowron

Absolutely, I would say it's a very, you could almost call it a strict process. And to the extent that you deviate from the process, by eliminating a step, you know, the results are never going to be as good and, and by the way, it doesn't mean that this is a tedious process, or a super time-consuming process. You can, you can achieve a lot in just a few days or weeks. Especially if you have a team that you can, you know, send components of the problem out to and then and then receive results back.

So, the steps really aren't, you know, the first step, it's this is, I think, I think people will find this interesting, the very first step is you want to be working with somebody that's tried to do this before, and has is not satisfied with the result, they've either absolutely failed or somewhat failed, and they understand what's happened. When you start a process a design process with somebody that's never done it before, you're starting utterly cold, you have no point of reference, and you don't have a good idea of what's, what may not work, which actually makes it harder, it's actually easier to work with somebody who's done it before and had varying degrees of success.

­And then, you know, the, we do a lot of hand sketching, actually, you know, I would say that that's my major contributor contribution to the process, as I hand sketched things, 3d sketches, sometimes color the different materials, and then give that to one of the members of my modeling team, they create a computer model of it, we start off with a massing diagram, you know, what we call a jello model. And then pretend that involve the client, get them to give their comments, write that in there, and then proceed to add layers and layers of detail with getting feedback at each phase. Then go into computer simulation of loads and loading, you know, finite element analysis, all that stuff. And then, you know, there's a decorative phase, I would say a styling phase that occurs, it can be integrated into the process or occur towards the end, you know, something that's, you know, brilliantly and beautifully designed but is ugly is as useless as something that's badly designed.

And then and then you know, in the end, then we often build prototypes, I would say 90% of the case, we build a physical prototype of the product. You know, projects seldom get cancelled. By the way I can say that I'm proud of that fact. We, we've typically vetted the whole concept before we start so then we move into a prototype. We evaluate the prototype, we rework the original computer model and the design, and then we may build a production version that's, you know, notionally fully rationalized. And that can be either the end of the process where it's all turned over to the client, or we in fact go on to manufacture that product on behalf of the client. So, so there's Yes, the substantially formal process.

John McMullen 

So can you describe some of the products that you've created and brought to market.

Julian Bowron

So the first group of products that I worked on, were all the industrial designer was somebody else, but I, to some extent, contributed details or, or in many cases, you know, substantial components of the design. So among the first, as I mentioned earlier, were systems furniture projects. Some of the clients were people like Technion, and Steelcase, and so on. We then did a bunch of medical work. I can't remember the name of the company, I believe they were absorbed back in the 90s. But it would be these hospital beds that put the patient into a variety of specialized positions that are appropriate for various types of surgeries, and medical procedures.

Then the there was drafting instruments, we did a bunch of work for a salty letraset on various drafting instruments. And then actually, my first real foray was into kiosks interactive kiosks. And we did a large number we did the largest deployment of automatic ticket machines in North America at the time for a national theater chain owned by Paramount. And that led into a whole bunch of work in check in and check out equipment for freight terminals, maintenance, like a maintenance, database access devices for nuclear power stations, and rail maintenance facilities, and so on.

And actually, interestingly, that business was wiped out by competition from China. You know, we were we were charging, say, $15,000-$20,000 for a specific piece of equipment, and not copies, but you know, similar equipment with similar functionality, started showing up from China less than half the price and just blew us out of the water. Interesting, you know, I'm not a huge protectionist, but, you know, despite having been a victim of that process. And then by the mid-2000s I was solidly into construction-related technology.

So, we developed cassette sealing systems, basically, you know, converting walls and ceilings into like, integrated circuits, almost with the wiring and ductwork as part of the structure. We did a bunch of module handling equipment module assembly equipment. At that time, we did the what we called the “humane minefield,” which was a border surveillance system that was deployed in actually desert regions that could distinguish between, you know, people with hostile intent, and like a shepherd tending a flock of sheep or something. So that, you know, people in lieu of a minefield. And we did a situation room, actually, for the National Reconnaissance organization with a bunch of specialized equipment in it. So and then, and then, you know, came they did, let's call it the structural modular era, which started off with the work for feature Walters and the work on the bow in Calgary and progressed into VectorBloc and then into the current work with METALOQ.

John McMullen 

That's quite the gamut!

Julian Bowron

Yeah, you know, I'm now older. So each of those phases is a good decade, you know, interestingly. So, yeah, there'd be a learning curve at the beginning of each decade, followed by an execution phase, followed by a phase where we were doing, you know, well, because we understood that category of stuff, and then it would become obsolete. You know, in some cases, the approach we're taking,

John McMullen 

Well, what can you tell me about the role of technology in modular construction today, which I guess is the phase of your life that we are in before we all become obsolete? What, what, how is technology affecting modular construction right now?

Julian Bowron

Well, I would say I'll say that I'm proud of the fact that back in in the 2000s, you know, I really, it became abundantly clear to me that precision was really important. And so, the aerospace industry and the automotive industry, the watchmaking industry, the appliance industry, you know, the furniture industry, everybody, by the 1950s, I guess, had figured out that cutting something accurately, machining something accurately, conceiving of good connection details, made work go together more easily.

So, the assembly line, you know, is a direct product of interchangeable components, as we all know. And that's an idea from one. So, what was incredible is you'd be looking at modular buildings, you know, in the, in the 2000s. And, you know, the wood framed modular buildings, in many cases, they would have inch tolerances or two-inch tolerances and so on. And this led to all kinds of difficulties in waterproofing the buildings and putting facades on the buildings.

And, and so it led up to my experience on 461 Dean, what is still the tallest modular building in the western hemisphere. And was until recently the tallest modular building around. And that was a, I think, 28-storey building, something like that. And it stalled about eight storeys off the ground due to tolerance accumulation. And I had already seen the impact of tolerance or accumulation on a variety of super tall tower projects that I worked on.

One of them was 180-storey building in Saudi Arabia, which at the time was the second tallest building in the world. And I ran a team that planned the erection of the top of that building the erection of the structural steel, and you'd see, you know, two parallel stocks of columns and beams and so on rising and they'd be gradually getting out of whack with each other, and then a, bring it back in with shims and then gradually get out of whack with each other and then bring it back in with shims. And there's this constant process of serving shimming, serving shimming, reaming, serving shaming reading, and, you know, you can't put up a modular building that just so completely violates the whole concept of Lego assembly and so on.

So, I would say the number one issue that’s the modular industry continues to face. But and it was worse 10 years ago, is a lack of appreciation for the value of precision in the components that are made in the factory and assembled to produce the module. And only by eliminating all, you know, Fiddle Faddle and, you know, craftsmanship and that sort of thing, can you actually get to the point where you're running a real assembly line. And that assembly line has to extend from the factory to the site. And I think this is a big missing factor, people can think that, “okay, well, if I got through making a module, I'm good to go.” But if that module doesn't assemble at the site, in the same way that a car door goes into a car on the assembly line, you failed.

So, I would say that that continues to be the biggest challenge in the modular industry, is a lack of appreciation of the value of precision. The fact that as I've said, many times, precision really is cheaper than imprecision. So people that think that precision is expensive and difficult and so on, ignore completely the fact that imprecision is far harder to deal with than precision.

John McMullen 

So tell me about your upcoming presentation at World of Modular. From your session description, it sounds like you are going to be sharing some some very helpful ideas about the challenges that you've seen.

Julian Bowron

Yeah, actually, the way I kind of presented it is, you know, "Doing the Math" or something like that. So, you know, as an example, a question that I'm frequently asked is, How big should my factory and, you know, if I, if I want to produce 1000 modules a year, how much space do I need, and so on. And it's actually quite easy to figure that out, once you take into account all the variables that go into that math. And so, you know, those are, those are the types of... I will say, I'm partly motivated by watching people spend, you know, $50-$100 million on on modular factories, and then not get productivity that corresponds to that level of investment. And I think in many cases, it's due to a failure to do the math.

So, and by the way, you know, all of this is publicly available information, interestingly, or has come to me through literally, you know, dozens of consulting gigs, with, with people in a variety of settings. And, and the problem, you know, right now, the modular industry, especially in North America is kind of a mile wide and an inch deep. You know, with With few exceptions, the companies are relatively small. And they're always starting from a from essentially the same spot, you know, how big should my factory be? Should I roll the modules along on wheels? Or should I have them on casters, or should they be on air bearings? Or should I, you know, move them around the room with a crane or, you know, what, you know, basic questions like that. And so, I want to take people through how you figure out which of those approaches makes the most sense for a specific situation.

John McMullen 

Sounds like an excellent, excellent use of someone's time at a big conference.

Speaking of big conferences, and you being at World of Modular, what can you tell me about your previous world of modular experiences? I've seen you there a few times. For an potential attendee, someone who's never been, what can you share about your experiences there and why they should take the leap and join us in Las Vegas in March?

Julian Bowron

Well, it's a very well-run conference. I say that I've been to a lot of shows, in a lot of different industries as a result of this, you know, long story I told earlier about all the different things I've done. And so it's just a particularly well-run conference.

It also has a bit of a, like a homecoming week atmosphere to it, because our industry really fundamentally is small. That's not a negative, I'd say it's, let's say it's even a tight knit group. And so the chance to interact with your peers and, and the, you know, the people the friendships that you've made over the past, decades, and the people that you have come to respect and know, you know, that's really invaluable. I would say that's my primary reason for going is actually just to, to see people in person and chat. You can say gossip. But also, there is a lot to be learned. I've certainly I've found that a number of the sessions have been extremely valuable to me, personally. I can say for examples, you know, hearing Michael, how are half the Irish fellow? Hawk, I believe? Yeah, the engineer of the of the vision type projects. Yeah. Uh huh. That's interesting. good pronunciation, good Irish pronunciation. So yeah, I mean, hearing him speak was just absolutely fascinating and very inspiring guy is really brilliant. And he's done some tremendous work. And there's been, of course, many others. So yeah, so that I, and by the way, I really enjoy Anirban Basu, the, you know, your keynote, who is the world's funniest economist.

John McMullen 

He's awesome. He's, he's just awesome.

Julian Bowron

And I really look for I would travel a long way to hear him speak. And yeah, and the one piece of advice I have for people is stay away from the free drinks.

John McMullen 

Oh, what is what's next for you? After your trips? Before Vegas? after Vegas? What's on the horizon for 2023?

Julian Bowron

Well, it seems to me I'm on my way to the Middle East. In the next couple of weeks. There's some very, very, you know, as they say, giga projects going on over there, that have certainly been on my radar for a number of years now. That that I would say would be the primary thing other than that, you know, I continue to run, I have a research and development shop here in Toronto, we continue to perfect the product, the tooling that produces the product, we've received some really terrific commissions for new equipment and for new products recently. So, there's no shortage of things to be done.

John McMullen 

Here's a question I like to ask people, I think I've been excited to ask you this question. In particular, given your history and your status as an inventor, you're the only inventor I know, what are the next three to five years look like for the industry? What's, what do you think is going to change? What do you think is the next new or big thing? What do we what are we looking forward to?

Julian Bowron

Well, it's a, you know, that's a really good question. And it shouldn't be such a good question. You know, we should all have a clearer picture of where this is headed. So I can answer that question best, I would say in the following way, I recently had a call with some senior government officials and, and the staff of their of their respective offices regarding the affordable housing problem that I think is common to almost all of the world's jurisdictions.

And, you know, here in Ontario, notionally, we have a shortage of a million homes, and a plan to build, you know, the, the government is talking about plans to build one and a half million homes in the near future and so on. I think we, you know, it's preaching to the choir, when speaking with people in the module industry to talk about the skilled labor shortage and so on. It's clear that that's reached a crisis level. And, and yet, in our province, there's really no plan and no foreseeable mechanism by which something like 50,000 or 100,000 modular homes get built a year.

In fact, that continues to be the case that the most, you know, the plants in North America with the greatest amount of output are hitting 2000 modules a year from a single site. And, you know, so interestingly, in the Middle East, we're working on factory designs with an output of 50,000 modules per annum, right These are realistic plans, I mean, with the equipment itemized, and costed and the, you know, the cost of borrowing the money and investor repaying investors all taken into account.

And so, I hope, I hope… I have to say that the next five years are all about getting to a scale, where we're making a meaningful difference in housing the many people who are currently lacking adequate housing, and I do strong continue to strongly believe that manufactured housing, industrialized construction is the only way to achieve that. And I also I would say, No, that government and industry have to work together to make that happen, you know, neither government nor industry will be able to do that on their own. And so seeing, you know, the efforts that the modular building Institute is taking to, to see that that cooperation happens is very heartening. And I think every one of us individually has to who are interested in solving the affordable housing crisis have to have to be looking in you have to be emulating what you're doing in our own circles of contacts.

John McMullen 

Thank you, Julian, I appreciate that answer. It's a good answer. When I came up with a question, I had no idea it was such a great question, but I've asked it of many people. And I continue to get great answers. So, I appreciate it. I appreciate your time. And I'm very much looking forward to seeing you in Las Vegas and I'm looking forward to your session. Thanks once again.

Julian Bowron

Likewise, I very much look forward to seeing you again and the whole team at the Modular Buildings Institute.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Expanding What's Possible in Modular Construction Logistics w/ Stream Modular

John McMullen

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Carson Holmquist, CEO at Stream Logistics. Carson is here to talk about the evolution of Stream Logistics and what the industry can look forward to in the months ahead, Carson, thanks for being here.

Carson Holmquist

John, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it.

John McMullen

My pleasure. Great to speak with you again. So, for anyone who may not have heard our previous conversation, we had one about a year ago, tell me about yourself and catch me up on what's going on with Stream Logistics.

Carson Holmquist

Yeah, so I'm the Co-founder and CEO of Stream Logistics. We've been around for about 11 years, and we've had a couple of distinct evolutions. One of which that I'm excited to talk about today is the launch of a new division of Stream Logistics that’s solely dedicated to transporting mods, pods and panels for the offsite construction industry, which is called Stream Modular.

So, I'm excited to talk about some details there, but as a company we've always been focused on working on the most difficult shipments in the industry. We've always gravitated towards problem solving and making sure that the companies we work with have bigger and brighter futures, and we want to be a part of that. So that's kind of how we found the modular industry, but we'll talk a little bit more about what we're doing, hopefully later in the conversation.

John McMullen

Very good. I remember, previously, you used the term high stakes freight. I liked that. It rolls off the tongue nicely. So, tell me sort of how that philosophy came about and how it's sort of run its course to your business over the past 11 years.

Carson Holmquist

Yeah, so in transportation, and probably more generally in almost any industry, there's kind of two macro approaches to business. It's either find the things that are less complicated, figure out how to scale them and make them more cost efficient, or you work on the difficult things and try to create better solutions for those. My business partner, Chad and I have always gravitated towards the latter, which is find those difficult problems, pour a lot of energy into and try to create some stability around things that are naturally unstable, and less predictable.

So that's how we discovered this concept that we call high stakes freight. These are shipments that have to go right because there's a lot on the line. Financial ramifications for being late, or there's reputational damage for not being able to pull a project together properly. We love the pressure of that, but also the room for us to create new solutions, we just get really excited about that process. So, we've committed ourselves, our team, our energy and our focus all to solving the most difficult things which we call high stakes freight, as compared to what we call routine freight that's just dock to dock. Easier on an individual shipment level, but the game there's about scale, we're playing a different game, which is about creativity and problem solving.

John McMullen

Can you talk about maybe some specific challenges that you've encountered with modular construction projects in the past? Are they maybe unique to projects? Do you see them throughout projects? Maybe some specifics on some of those more difficult challenges that you faced?

Carson Holmquist

Yeah, the reason why we gravitated towards the world of modular, which we think about as a term of art. It includes panelized, construction pods modules, it's a perfect example and environment of high stakes freight, where we have to be on time because there's a set crew waiting. So, if there's idle labor there, it's very expensive. It throws the whole production and construction schedule off. We really love that about the modular industry.

So, the challenges we run into a lot is speed. How can we do this efficiently and quickly to capture the primary benefit of offsite construction, which is speed occupancy. There's a lot of benefits, but that's the primary one. The second thing that we always have to think about is overcoming constraints. Whether that's space constraints, storing modules at a factory, the constraints of a staging yard of ingress and egress to a project site.

There's always some element of constraints and sometimes they look different from project to project. There are overlapping themes where we have to be creative on how do we overcome these constraints to make sure we're super reliable on getting the modules or the components to the jobsite on time. Also, we're very efficient doing it so we're keeping budget in mind. So that's what really drew us to the modular industry. It’s a perfect example of what we call high stakes freight.

John McMullen

So, you've been in the modular industry for a while. You found success, you've been doing a good job, and you are introducing Stream Modular. Tell me about that decision and why and what, where, and when.

Carson Holmquist

Over the last, it's been about three and a half years since we really encountered this industry and started to fall in love with it. These projects really demanded the best within ourselves. So, challenge our team to continue to get better. We also saw that this industry is craving better solutions. It really requires better transport solutions to get the most out of the concept of offsite construction. We've been investing a lot of time and attention thinking about this industry. At Stream Logistics, we also serve other industries. So, we were getting these great experiences in the modular industry, but that experience was fragmented amongst a lot of team members.

The decision to launch Stream Modular is all about specialization. We're taking some incredible team members from Stream Logistics, putting them over at Stream Modular, and they are only working on transport for mods, pods and panels. So, their entire day is steeped in this world. We're learning much faster, there's faster iteration cycles for the development of our solutions. At the end of the day, the whole concept we think about is density of repetition. Our team members are just getting repetition after repetition of designing project solutions, implementing them, managing projects, and we're learning very quickly. That was the decision where it's like, specialization is going to get us to a place where we can help the industry even faster and even more effectively.

John McMullen

So, tell me about the scope of Stream Modular. Are you guys serving all the same areas as Stream Logistics did? Is it different or smaller, you're growing?

Carson Holmquist

Yeah. So, we're definitely going to be growing in the sense of our investment in the industry. Our footprint is still going to be primarily the US, but we are transporting in and out of Canada and starting to ship out of Mexico as well. There are several factories popping up in Mexico, so transport across that border is important as well. We're not bound geographically. It's more about where are the factories, how do they need help and then we'll create solutions around them in their market. Building that network of drivers that allow us to serve both the peaks of demand. When projects are booming and making sure that we have the flexibility to scale down as they have their roles, to make sure that everything's going to be cost effective.

John McMullen

Very good. You guys, I believe, are exhibiting at the upcoming World of Modular. What can attendees expect to hear from you and see at your booth? What can they look forward to in general from Stream?

Carson Holmquist

Yes, you're correct. We are exhibiting and we're very excited about that opportunity. We were there last year as well. It's a great opportunity for us to connect with pretty much all the major players in the industry, which is really exciting for us. One thing that we've got a lot of positive feedback on is we just launched what we're calling factory carrier pool. It's a pool of hydraulic carriers, these very specialized trailers for the modular industry, and we're in the process of building the largest fleet in the industry of these specialized trailers. We've already gotten a ton of interest, have had a lot of project scoping calls around the utility and use of these trailers, and I think that's going to be a really big topic amongst the people in the room at World of Modular.

Hopefully, then come to our booth, talk to us about that among other things, but that's a big commitment we're making. We've seen a high demand for these trailer capabilities, where essentially, the trailer can load and unload a module on and off of cribbing. It's very fast, it's effective. It doesn't put a lot of torsional forces on the module so it's a gentle process. There's far more demand for these trailers than there are supplied today. So essentially, if we wanted to help out and source some of these trailers for factory, we'd have to pull them from Factory B, or C and that's not really helping the industry as a whole. So, we know to solve that problem, we're going to have to make a massive investment in building a fleet of these trailers, and pairing that with skilled drivers who can actually haul them safely and effectively. That's one of the biggest commitments we're making this year and that's a topic where we've got a lot of interest. I imagine at World of Modular, that's going to be our main theme that we're talking about.

John McMullen

Very exciting. So, what's the process for making these trailers? You said there isn't enough supply, everyone wants to use them. Why are they more difficult to make? Are they more expensive? Are they more complicated? What's the issue?

Carson Holmquist

Yes, all the above. More difficult to build, just more complicated. It's not rocket science, but there's more that goes into it. They're far more expensive. I think that's it. The primary hurdle is let's say a factory wants to partner with trucking companies and they want these trailers. Well, it's a massive commitment for a trucking company to go buy a fleet big enough to service any large-scale factory. A lot of them just haven't been willing to make that investment. So, we've heard a lot of factories are having to buy their own hydraulic carriers, then hire a trucking company to do power only just basically pulling around their trailers. These factories are forced to use their credit or their cash to go buy assets to help their business achieve the goals that they want to achieve. They have a lot better uses for that cash or that credit. Like they're in growth mode, a lot of these factories.

So we wanted to take the pressure off of them and make that long term. These financial investments we're making are going to help accelerate the industry, help factories reach their highest potential and in turn, obviously, that's going to be good for our business. It's a bet we're comfortable making because of all these conversations we've had and we know the demand is out there. The early conversations we've had since we started building out this carrier pool is really proving the concept we know is in high demand.

John McMullen

Excellent. And you'll have to forgive me, I know very little about trailers. I've seen pictures of modules, they're on a flatbed, they're going down the highway or wherever, what makes these so much better than a flatbed that you would just put a module on and crane it off?

Carson Holmquist

The first thing is they're built specifically to haul modules. All the little nuances and details have modules in mind. For example, they have outriggers, which are bars that essentially telescope out to add the trip for trailer width. So if you have a 16 foot wide module sitting on an eight and a half foot trailer, it's not nearly as stable as if you put these outriggers on to extend to 16 feet. They also have the ability to extend the length to accommodate longer modules. The first wave of the trailers that we're building, extend out to 70 feet, for example. The primary functionality that makes it particularly useful for modular is this self-loading and unloading capability.

So imagine the deck of the trailer has ability to rise and lower, allowing a driver to essentially back underneath a module that's sitting up on cribbing, lift the trailer up which gently essentially loads the module onto the trailer, then we can move the cribbing out of the way, drop the trailer back down to writing height, strap the module on and it's ready to go. There's no crane, no loading equipment, it doesn't even require any support or labor from the factory workers. The driver can do all this himself. Then that module can be transported to a staging yard and the reverse can happen where we might be staging dozens or potentially hundreds of modules in an empty lot. A lot of those lots don't have any type of lifting equipment so the ability for the driver to do the reverse, which is basically back into position, set up some cribbing, drop the module onto the cribbing and then pull out, essentially self-unloading, is a huge efficiency. It benefits and reduces costs, because the factories don't have to set up lifting equipment cranes or some other type of way to load and unload the modules.

So, it's an efficiency play. It's a cost savings play and the factories that have committed to this set of operations, absolutely fall in love with it. They don't want to do anything else. There's a lot of work around. So, if they built their operations around having access to these trailers and then they don't have them, it's a huge bottleneck that really cuts into the benefits of modular construction, which is one of the biggest ones is speed occupancy. So, if they're late on their deliveries, you're carving into that benefit that they sold the developer on. That's why this is really important for the industry, but it's one of many investments we're making. I think it's going to be one of the most impactful things we do here in 2023.

John McMullen

Very exciting and thank you for the details, I feel educated. So, I brought up World of Modular before, I was wondering if you could maybe help me out as a previous attendee. What can you tell us about your previous experience at World of Modular that might help a prospective attendee who's never been before? Make the jump and register for the show?

Carson Holmquist

Yeah, I think once you go to World of Modular the more appropriate question is why wouldn't you go? To more directly answer your question, it's a place where the industry gathers. It’s some of the brightest minds, the people most committed to solving these challenges are best utilizing the concept of offsite construction. It's a roomful of innovators and very exciting to be around. It's just a unique place where everyone gathers in one spot. So, if you are committed to the industry or interested in the industry, there's no other opportunity like this.

To get in the room with others who are trying to do the same thing. It's invaluable to us. So, we love this time of year. Right now we're already setting up meetings, we're looking at the attendees, we know who we want to talk to and we're making a lot of investments and sending the team out there to make sure that we can connect with everyone who wants to connect with us and vice versa. So, we love the World of Modular and most of the industry does as well.

John McMullen

That was a fantastic answer. Thank you very much. What is next for you and Stream Modular? I know you're making this big investment and 2023 is going to be very exciting for you. Is there a timeline in place for when you're going to start expanding your fleet of these trailers? Are you going to have some by the end of the year? Is it 2024? Is there a general timeline you can give us?

Carson Holmquist

Yeah, yeah. So, with regard to the trailers, we'll have our first order and delivery, which will be six hydraulic trailers sometime in mid to late April. The goal is to have 24 by the end of the year, so they're just going to continually be built in waves of six because that's the capacity in which we could build them. Beyond that, I would imagine a similar pace to continue going into 2024 based off the demand we're seeing. We're also making commitments to make investments in other areas. We're working on API, integration with Moducore, the factory operating system software. The goal there is to make sure that anyone using that software to run their factory operations can also get all the important transport data that they need into their core system.

We can do API tracking details, shipment confirmations, and even documentation such as signed proof of deliveries, and even pictures so that we can close that loop cycle within Moducore. We're going to take that same concept to the other factory operating system software's and try to do that. That's another investment we're making. We'll be announcing over the next few weeks some other things we're working on to make sure that factories can operate at the highest potential. That's our goal. Our mission is to help accelerate the adoption of modular construction. We know we have a lot of work to do to help the factories remove obstacles to doing what they want to do. So, there's more to come there. In terms of the trailers, we will definitely have meaningful capacity being built by the end of the year.

John McMullen

Awesome. It sounds like you guys are really taking a look at everything on a holistic level, where you can fill gaps and provide service and I think that's awesome. If you could identify one thing that you'd like other modular project stakeholders to know about the importance of logistics, what would it be?

Carson Holmquist

I think the factories that are doing it really well take the process really seriously, meaning they see value to be extracted out of the logistics process. So, they're thinking about it earlier in the project cycle. They're asking their partners to be creative and co-create solutions to be more efficient, more cost effective. I think that pays dividends when the project actually starts. They see projects run smoother, they’re more efficient, allows set crews to set more modules a day because everything’s more organized.

So, I think if you're a factory looking to gain some efficiencies, a good place to look is logistics. A good place to start there is to start having conversations earlier and try to work with companies that are dedicated to this industry. If you're working with a trucking company that does all sorts of freight their attention is going to be fragmented. They're not going to be looking for solutions as vigorously as other companies. So, I think those are good places to start.

John McMullen

Very good. I've got one last question for you and I've asked this of manufacturers and designers, but I think you might be able to provide a different perspective, which I'm looking forward to. What do you think the next three to five years will be like for modular construction, I guess in particular for logistics, but for the industry at large? Are we on the brink of something new and exciting? Are we seeing step by step improvements and things? Are we on the verge of something big?

Carson Holmquist

I think we're on the verge of something big if we can pull off something specifically. So, there's a few groups of people and some really impressive individuals who are actively trying to work on getting some sort of nationalized building code for modular. These factories can start doing closed wall manufacturing, they can start building the same product with higher replication and capture the efficiencies that, frankly, a lot of other countries already have. I think if that happens, the industry has potential to explode, where we can really capture the efficiencies on the industrialized construction front. So, making factories run like manufacturing factories. I think right now, the factories are a little handicapped by the fact that they can't build the same thing over and over because of code in a lot of instances.

So, I think that's big. The individuals who I've spoken to who are working on it are very optimistic of that happening sometime in the near future. I don't know all the details of what it's going to take to pull that off, but I can understand the resulting effect it could have on the industry. Our goal is to be prepared for something like that. So it's starting to build the infrastructure so that these factories, when they do take off or when new factories come online, we have systems to support as many of them as we can.

John McMullen

Very good. Well, I know that is going to be a huge discussion within the industry. I know MBI is going to be playing a big part in that. We'll have to see how that turns out, but there's definitely potential there. We'll have to see where that goes.

Thank you, Carson, very much for your time. It's great to talk to you as always and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Las Vegas in about a month.

Carson Holmquist 

Yes, same. We really appreciate the time and allowing us to talk about Stream Modular. I'm excited to see you and excited to see everyone else at World of Modular. It’s going to be fun.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: the Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.Modular Design & Development 101: How to Start a Modular Building Project w/ LAI Design Group

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Ken Puncerelli, CEO at LAI Design Group. Ken is here to talk about modular construction from an architectural and development point of view and give a preview of his upcoming session at MBI’s 2023 World of Modular. Ken, thanks for being here.

Ken Puncerelli 

Hey, John, thanks so much for setting this up. We really appreciate it. We're flattered to be here.

John McMullen 

It is absolutely my pleasure. So, let's dive in. Tell me about yourself. What's your background and how did you get started in architecture and development?

Ken Puncerelli 

Well, that's a really good question. The funny thing is, as a kid, I always loved real estate. It's the weirdest thing, I used to ride my bike through neighborhoods in Tenafly, New Jersey, which is near the George Washington Bridge and takes you to New York City. A friend of mine by the name of Jean Bowen, lived in a really nice neighborhood and I used to help him with his paper route. He and I had snow shoveling routes, lawn mowing routes, did landscaping and all this stuff. I really loved real estate and then I found myself through high school, junior high really working construction jobs for masons and carpenters back before they had child labor laws. I'm not sure if those are really good to have, I think kids should work, but anyway, I did that as a kid. When I got into college, I studied design and then at a graduate level, I also studied business and finance. I think finance is one of the most important things for a design professional, to kind of bring the whole world of development together, just because you then become the complete left brain, right brain professional, and you can be the best advocate for your client.

John McMullen 

I have not heard that point of view before that, but that makes a lot of sense. So, tell me about when you started incorporating modular construction into your portfolio. When did you get interested in that?

Ken Puncerelli 

Well, that's a good question. What actually ended up happening is modular found us we didn't find modular if the truth be told. That happened about either 2003 or 2004. We had a modular manufacturer by the name of Guerdon Enterprises, and they're very well known in the industry. They were fairly new, as well. I wouldn't say startup company, but they were a new company at that time in the early 2000s. We did a workforce housing project for them up in the mountains in Gypsum, Colorado. Then we didn't work together again for probably close to a decade and it wasn't by choice. It was just kind of happenstance.

We all went different directions. Then we got reacquainted in the Bakken or Williston, North Dakota, when the oil boom was going on, from about 2010- 2011 until everything kind of died down from a development standpoint in early 2015. So, we found ourselves reacquainted and reengaged with Guerdon and others in that region of the US. It was actually pretty cool.

John McMullen 

So, tell me about the project itself. Did you have any challenges? I know modular can be sort of a very different sort of skill set when it comes to design and construction. What were your big hurdles for those first projects?

Ken Puncerelli 

Yeah, so that's something that really comes down to understanding the parameters for design as well as shipping, logistics, client expectations about what modular is and what it isn't. Now, my philosophy is that you can hang, when I say hang, you can ornament or put ornamentation on any building using modular or virtually any building using a modular construction delivery method. The biggest thing we had to wrap our brains around is okay, how big is a bedroom for example. Then how does that translate into a master ensuite? If you're thinking about apartments, how does that width translate into a hallway and then to a mirror image apartment on the other side? Once you start wrapping your brain around the minimum and maximum as well as optimum width of a modular box, the maximum lengths for shipping and putting that box on a lowboy truck, then the world kind of becomes your oyster, then you can kind of wrap your brain.

John McMullen 

So now that your brain is wrapped around modular construction, tell me about how your process starts now. Once you understand the scope of a project, what's your first step?

Ken Puncerelli 

So because our firm is involved we have landscape architects that do land planning and zoning. I myself am trained in both architecture and landscape architecture. We start by programming of the site, how big is the site, and then just like you would with a site build project, what's the intended building use, square footage, number of apartments that the developer wants, and hotels, or anything else like that. So, we start out really the same way that we would with a site built project and kind of go from there.

John McMullen 

So, one question I like asking architects and designers, because you have definitely a different point of view than manufacturers or anyone else, are most modular products very similar from your point of view or does each project need to have a unique module design that requires sort of starting from scratch?

Ken Puncerelli 

Okay, so conceptually, yes they're similar, but each is unique given the fact that each site is different. Oftentimes, each client because of either the site or the economic projections of a client's project, dictate something unique about it. That and site built projects have that same common denominator. We begin really by sketching prototypical floor plans using a modular grid system and using the pattern of sizes and shapes that can be produced in the factory using that system. Then, like I intimated before, we also need to keep in mind the maximum width and links for shipping purposes.

So, we can't just think about design, we have to think about engineering and logistics. The optimum width of a modular box itself is about 14 feet wide. You can go down to 10, go up to about 20 and I've heard people talk about going to 21, or 22. When you get up to about 16 feet wide, you need additional assistance in the transportation of that project. So, you need escorts, the chaser cars, all them with the lights and everything to alert other drivers on the interstates that you've got a wide load semi, hauling these boxes down the road. So that's another part of it. Lastly, the one major difference with modular versus a site build is because the ground floor if it's not a site built ground floor like a podium parking garage, or the first floor of a hotel that's got all of the lobby and all of that kind of stuff in it. The first floor will have a crawl space underneath the foundation. So that's something you have to wrap your head around when designing a module.

John McMullen 

So, in terms of modular structures themselves, is there a difference in the design of a module that's intended say for a single family home versus a multifamily or a hotel project or are they all generally the same?

Ken Puncerelli 

The short answer is yes, they are different. So, a house falls under a different set of construction standards whereas multifamily hotel and other commercial structures have a host of additional requirements. These include sprinkler systems, fire rated assemblies, sound attenuation between apartments or hotels, ADA, which is the American Disabilities Act. This encapsulates design in hotels, in particular, sight impaired, hearing impaired, as well as wheelchair accessibility. Whereas oftentimes in a multifamily setting, it's often just the wheelchair accessibility.

In addition to that there's occupancy loads for fire and fire separation. I think I mentioned sprinkler systems, as well as other structural considerations such as shear walls and a lot of these kinds of things. Shear walls are somewhat built into the modular design because each box has to be its own sustainable room, so to speak, and series of walls. A lot of people ask me, well is modular shoddy construction? I said, no it's actually better built than my own personal residence, which I was the designer.

John McMullen 

What don't people understand about designing for modular construction? Is there something you find yourself repeating to clients about the process?

Ken Puncerelli 

I do, especially lately. As I told you, we started in around 2003 or 2004, we picked it up again in the next decade, then it went away. We found in our shop that clients weren't asking for modular after 2015. It kind of just evaporated in our office until about 2020, when the pandemic hit and because of that, I now think it's here to stay. Whereas it was kind of ebb and flow because most people in the construction industry are late adopters. So, something new and different is scary than the way they've done it for 50 years.

One thing with mod, when you say it's modular and it's manufactured in a factory, you still have to reiterate to a client that keep in mind, it's still construction. You're not buying an Ikea bookshelf that's perfectly pristine and without imperfections. This is still construction and there are things that need to be resolved in the field from time to time that weren't contemplated either in design, they were missed in the factory, or a host of other things. You should have a healthy appreciation that about 60% of the construction of your new building is done in a factory, the other 40% is on site. As a result of that, the other biggest thing that I say is make sure you have an experienced contractor build your project. I think that's key because as design or construction professionals, we're also psychologists. We have to be able to convey information, even bad news, and come up with solutions.

John McMullen 

As I mentioned at the top, you are planning to speak at MBI’s upcoming World of Modular. Your presentation is about the fundamentals of modular design. I noticed in your session description that you're going to touch on regulatory permitting considerations as well. Can you tell me more about what attendees can expect from that portion of your session?

Ken Puncerelli 

Yeah, and it'll be high level at the session, but it's important for the audience. Some are experienced developers of modular and others are trying to learn about it and get into it. One of the things that is important for people to understand, just like when you go through a planning and zoning submittal and there's multiple agencies within an application, the same is true for modular. It's not just pulling a building permit with the local building official, the plans actually are submitted to the state engineer’s office for review. Additionally, there's third party inspections that occur at the factory for compliance with codes. I always think, and sometimes this happens and sometimes it doesn't, I always think it's a really good idea to meet with local building officials. Do a workshop with them, explain how the project works, and have your contractor there in attendance. It's not only educational for a building official, but it's also a good relationship builder for all because once you're in the throes of construction, at least everybody's been briefed on this.

I find that fear comes through ignorance. If enough people don't have a relationship to begin with and they don't have any information to begin with, then there's all kinds of distrust and fear. As a result of that, you can have some real conflicts in the field. What happens is, if you do a little workshop type of meeting with the building officials to begin with, I'm talking to local building officials that may not have experienced module before, it almost functions like a pre application or a prebuilding permit type of meeting to get everybody on the same page about construction details. What's different from what they're used to seeing, life safety, the ADA, fire rated assemblies, how we're addressing this or that, fire sprinkler systems, all kinds of things. It’s really just a great dialogue. I think as we all know in life, if you're failing to communicate, you're failing.

John McMullen 

You weren't kidding about the psychology aspect of your profession. It sounds like you've been well versed in all the ins and outs of good communication with your stakeholders. So, that's fantastic advice.

Ken Puncerelli 

Thank you. Well, my hair used to be black and I had more.

John McMullen 

So, without ruining too much of your presentation, I was wondering if you could walk me through the process of permitting a modular or prefabricated project, maybe a multifamily residential project. Are there common regulatory hurdles that projects face?

Ken Puncerelli 

Sure. So, as I stated the state permit process, once you're approved, you walk through the local jurisdiction. You submit to the state, then the local jurisdiction will review the plans. What happens is they'll typically defer to the state engineers office for approval. Typically, a local building department doesn't take over, but they will do periodic site inspections or inspections on site. This kind of goes back to my previous commentary about having that workshop meeting. Sometimes you can have a local inspector, that's new to the building inspection business, new to modular and perhaps wants to make a name for themselves. Sometimes you can get conflicting direction from the two agencies. At the end of the day, you have got to satisfy everybody and get the project built because delays are not good for projects.

John McMullen 

They never are and you have to forgive my ignorance. I'm going to ask perhaps what may be an obvious question. Is the permitting process different for different types of buildings? In your experience, does it really matter if the project is modular or not?

Ken Puncerelli 

Well, I think it does. It is different if it's modular or not. I think we've kind of cited some reasons but in addition to that, back to your question about multifamily versus hotel, the big items are exiting the building, smoke detection, fire dampers and your heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, sprinklers, fire rated assemblies and ADA. So, a multifamily building and hotel are very similar. One is an R two type of building, which is the multifamily and the hotel is R one. So, there are similar things but a bit more intense because one is a much more intensified commercial building. So ADA, for hearing impaired and visually impaired, those types of things are more prevalent in hotels.

John McMullen 

What’s one piece of advice you might offer to an owner developer who's thinking about or has decided to use modular construction for the first time? What should he or she know at the outset?

Ken Puncerelli 

That's a really good question. For me, I would not advocate a developer who has never developed before site built to use modular. I would say, after they're seasoned from a site build perspective, then I would say their experiences and expectations about construction will align better. Honestly, like all construction projects, nothing is perfect. Sometimes you're making modifications in the field to make it work for a variety of reasons.

John McMullen 

Don't dive into the deep end of the pool essentially is what I'm hearing.

Ken Puncerelli 

That’s probably the best bit of advice. I just had a client ask me about that and he's never done development before. I said, you know, I would just do these townhomes that you want to do for rent as site build first to get your feet wet in development. There's enough headaches with construction and development without, as you said, diving into the deep end of the pool.

John McMullen 

Very good. Again, without ruining too much of your presentation because I don't want to do that, can you share what you're most looking forward to sharing with the attendees at World of Modular?

Ken Puncerelli 

I want to share design parameters for a variety of case study projects to attempt to take the mystery and myth out of design using a modular system. How I start out my presentation is showing really what modular perception is and what it really is. Then what I do is I go through a series of case studies, beginning with designing the most simple structure, a house. We go from there into more complex buildings, such as multifamily, student housing and hotels to just kind of show how the volumetric parameters of a modular box work in laying out floor plans. How this is the same stuff that you've seen before with onsite two by sixes and roofing nails, but it's a bit different.

John McMullen  

So you've presented at other shows before. What made you decide that the World of Modular show was a place you wanted to be? What about the show attracted you?

Ken Puncerelli 

I think there's a lot of great networking. There's a lot of different perspectives from people that you meet there. Vendors that serve the industry. So, it's really an opportunity to learn.

John McMullen 

What's next for you?

Ken Puncerelli 

We're looking at a student housing project in North Carolina that we did some conceptual design for about two years ago. Now it is actually coming to fruition with financing. So, we're looking at that starting up here probably summertime. Then another student housing project for a university down in Louisiana that will also be modular. We're doing a couple of townhome projects in Colorado. Workforce housing where speed to market is the key along with acknowledging a very short construction season. We're also looking at some hotel projects as well and Alabama.

John McMullen 

Very cool. Lastly, a question I like asking people from all different areas of modular construction, what do you think the next three to five years will be like for the modular construction industry?

Ken Puncerelli 

Well, as I stated earlier, I think the construction industry is predominantly populated by late adopters because you've done the same thing for 50 years and if you change, it’s scary. There can be liability associated with it and so forth. So, here's my take. I think the industry will better embrace this method of delivery now that it's been around and become more prevalent for a while due to labor shortages, tighter construction cycles, improvements in technology in the manufacturing process. Frankly, I think because of that it will likely result in better cost structures for developers.

John McMullen 

Excellent answer. Thank you, Ken. I really appreciate your time today. It's been great to talk with you and I'm very much looking forward to seeing you at World of Modular later on in March.

Ken Puncerelli 

We are too. Thank you so much. We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and your audience.

John McMullen 

My name is John McMullen and this has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.A Bird's Eye View of the Middle Eastern Modular Construction Market w/ MMY Global

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Robin Bartram Brown, Managing Director at London-based MMY Global. As well as with Dr. Anas Bataw, Managing Director at the Centre of Excellence and Smart Construction. Robin and Anas are here to talk about the development and construction of modular building mega projects around the world with a focus on the Middle East.

Robin, Anas, thanks for being here. Robin, why don't you kick this off. Tell me about yourself and about MMY.

Robin Bartram Brown

So MMY Global, we're based in the UK, in London, we also have a subsidiary in the US. We advise clients, developers, governments funds on the use of modern methods of construction within their supply chain.

John McMullen

Very good and Anas, introduce yourself, please and tell me about yourself.

Dr. Anas Bataw

Thanks. So, as you mentioned, Director of the Centre of Excellence and Smart Construction. So, within the Center, we work with what we call the triple helix, where government, industry and academia work together for a better construction industry. We obviously focus quite a lot on sustainability, productivity performance and obviously offsite manufacturing and modular construction plays a big role within that.

John McMullen

How did you guys meet and what's the nature of your work together?

Dr. Anas Bataw

So, we originally met in a number of projects that we had engaged together on in Saudi Arabia. Within Saudi Arabia there's a lot of growth when it comes to construction. The need for new methods of construction because of the timeframes that we have, but also the costs and the quality that's required. Therefore, there's a lot of requirements when it comes to offsite manufacturing and therefore modular. This is where Robin and MMY played a big role in some of the work that we're doing. To help us with a number of things mainly to do with procurements of modular construction, suppliers, and also looking at the different methodologies of how to approach modular on these projects.

John McMullen

Gotcha. So, Robin, how would you describe the demand differences between the US, Europe, and Middle East? What industries are prominent?

Robin Bartram Brown

It's a good question. The UK is obviously flying at the moment with modular so there's a lot of buy-to-own high-rise projects that are becoming extremely successful. I'd say that that's where the UK is moving to at the moment. In the States, it's predominantly been hospitality and that's performed very well. I think now the industry is advanced, and it's starting to get to cost parity against traditional construction. I think you're going to see a push towards affordable housing now. In America, low rise, four story, that kind of walk-up affordable housing schemes, 200 units, that seems to be really starting to come to the forefront.

In the Middle East, it's very new. I think predominantly, there certainly won't be any timber, because culturally, timber is just not used in the Middle East. It mainly will be steel for hospitality and concrete is very popular in the Middle East because they're good at using concrete. They've used precast for a lot of years, and they've got an established ecosystem for that type of material. So very different to the UK, very different to the US, quite similar to the Singapore model where they use a lot of volumetric concrete mods.

John McMullen

You preempted my next question. I was going to ask about the differences in systems, but you mentioned the predominant use of concrete in the Middle East. Why is that?

Robin Bartram Brown

So, there's a plentiful supply of dredged material. So base material for concrete. Concrete traditionally required a lower skill base to use successfully. It's used throughout the Middle East, Asia, you know, an awful lot. It's used everywhere, but more so in these countries. In the Middle East and Saudi in particular have become very, very good at using concrete and precast. So, it's like anything, you use what you know and people don't like change. We work for development companies, funds and the government. If the people that we're working with have experience in precast and concrete, then that's naturally what they're going to be led towards because it's what they’re used to. Actually Singapore, have used that very, very successfully on some serious high-rise projects.

John McMullen

Anas, I move to you. Can you speak to the wider Middle East North Africa region? Is demand increasing there? If so, what are some of the factors driving that trend?

Dr. Anas Bataw

Absolutely. So, the demand is definitely increasing. It started off I think, about 10 years ago. This was the move from precast manufacturers. They wanted to move on to modular. A lot of them flew to Singapore to see the developments happening in Singapore. The reason why is because they're very close to what they're doing in terms of concrete rather than steel as Robin mentioned. The drivers mainly, and we've seen this across the giga projects or the mega projects across the past 10 years where we have housing projects, we had major development projects, such as the Expo 2024 for Dubai, as well as the World Cup in Qatar, and the major developments that are happening in Saudi Arabia now with the 2030 vision. There was a time where the word modular or the word preassembly or pre manufacturing was not on the table unless you have a time issue. Not so much in terms of sustainability and waste management to start with.

So, it had a lot to do with time. If you have a time issue, let's bring in this conversation. That's the way it was led. In many cases, it was a lot more costly to bring in modular to start off with, and that was okay. In Expo, we did a lot of off-site manufacturing on the cuff we did a lot as well. In Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier, we started to see it quite a lot, but mainly for the projects that are time driven. Slowly but surely, the other conversations are coming in, which are basically, let's drive mass production, which ultimately will drive the cost down. Let's drive it from a sustainability perspective, just in time deliveries and all these kind of things that will come in as well. We don't see that yet. We have seen it in such as Expo, for example, because sustainability was a big element in the Expo. The fact that things had to be there for a certain time period. So, it had to be reassembled, and etc. That takes a lot of boxes, but as I said, mainly it's to do with time.

Robin Bartram Brown

So, in the UK, very developed modular market. In the US, very developed modular, off-site, volumetric, whatever want to call it market. We've reached now, finally, cost parity. It's taken time, it's taken lots of mistakes, it's taken lots of money and some false starts for some very, very big businesses. We've reached cost parity, the difference with the Middle East is there's not really an established manufacturing base, they're localized. So, you've always got to add shipping and logistics. That always makes the cost more per square foot per square meter.

The difference in the last couple of years is because of the shocks from the pandemic, the pricing, the increases in pricing, the lack of labor, all the good stuff that we talk about in this industry all the time. The lack of GCs, lack of skills, lack of experience because labor rates have gotten so expensive. We've made some advances in automation and we can make the mods a little bit cheaper. It's almost there in Saudi without localization and manufacturing. Once that manufacturing actually starts, then there's that parity. At that point, the conversations become so much easier with developers. Not that you're just going to get it quicker, the quality is going to be better, you've got less people onsite, but it's the same that you'd pay building it traditionally. That's when you start getting the really big wins.

John McMullen

With all the work that's gone into bringing sort of the Middle East up to speed with where the US is where the Europe is, certainly they're leading the way in many respects. I was wondering if you could give maybe some examples of modular construction projects that you guys have worked on in the Middle East and maybe share how they've contributed to the overall development of the region.

Dr. Anas Bataw

So, there's a lot of projects that we see happening. I mentioned the Expo. So, there was a lot of off-site manufacturing within Expo for several reasons. So that definitely did tik a lot of boxes. We saw the birth of a modular company within Dubai or Middle East because of the Expo.

John McMullen

For those who are not familiar with the Expo, what was that event? What was it about?

Dr. Anas Bataw

It's a World Exhibition that happens every four years in a country and Dubai hosted in 2020, or actually 2021, due to the pandemic. When countries had locations or plots to design and build a building for themselves, the ultimate purpose of this is to showcase the country and traditions during the duration of six months within the exhibition. So therefore, there's a lot of countries that wanted to do something that they can reassemble, disassemble and move it after the Expo has finished. That was one element, why modular was used. Steel was one of the major ones and as I mentioned because of that, a lot of contractors locally because they were involved in these projects. Although they were commissioned internationally and they were commissioned by organizations outside of UAE, they saw the deeds or the benefits of modular.

Some of them have heard about it before, some of them haven't. A lot of them have experienced it because there was a requirement by the lot of the clients on Expo. Therefore, they saw the benefits. They saw how easier it is than they expected because a lot of people thought it was complicated. I remember when I was at Expo, a lot of contractors were quite worried with the fact that we requested for modular or off-site manufacturing. That was a lesson learned for everyone. It did have a great impact and not only within Expo, we saw this outside. We saw the birth of many, many off-site manufacturing companies. Mainly concrete to be honest in the region, as Robin mentioned, for the right reasons. This is what people are familiar with, but also we had a few steel manufacturing as well in the region. Not that they all had a very smooth experience to expand and grow, but they definitely had the opportunity to at least initiate within the region.

John McMullen

Well, it sounds like there's a tremendous amount of excitement in the region for modular construction, industrialized construction of all kinds. I was wondering, and we deal a lot with these issues being based in North America, there's a lot of 50 states 50 different state building codes. What's the regulatory landscape in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia in particular. What rules do modular construction companies in Saudi Arabia in the Middle East have to follow?

Dr. Anas Bataw

So, when it comes to modular there isn't. Especially within Saudi Arabia, there isn't anything in terms of building regs that was mentioned specifically anything to do with modular. In fact, in some cases, it could be a little bit against it because of the requirements. Especially the steel manufacturer and manufacturing of steel modules, due to the fire-resistant requirements, due to the soundproofing. So, there are a lot of things that could go against modular. With that said, there is a lot of work that's happening. I know a lot of ex-colleagues that are working towards enhancing the building regulations and building requirements. This is happening from a ministerial level, and also happening from the private sector as well, there's a lot of push towards that. I think it's just a matter of getting things up and running. It's definitely not the issue that we have in the US. We're not going to end up with 50 different regulations.

Robin Bartram Brown

Yeah, and that's the struggle John. In the US, you've said it, it's 50 Different states, 50 different codes, 50 different codes inside those 50 different codes. You go and install a mod in Kentucky and you need to have a plumber in the factory to sign off the plumbing. Then you go and install a mod five miles away in Indiana and you don't need to. Or you might be putting one in New York that has to have some kind of plastic pipe in it. I mean, it's just really challenging in the US. That's something that certainly needs to go over here.

John McMullen

So, one of the things I know the US market is big on, Europe has been for a long time is sustainability. How to build greener, how to build with less waste? What are some of the initiatives that are happening in the Middle East region to promote sustainable construction? How does modular construction contribute to those goals?

Robin Bartram Brown

I'm going to have to give this one to Anas because he's literally the regional expert on sustainability.

Dr. Anas Bataw

Well, when it comes to sustainability, we've had a lot of improvements in the past 10-15 years in the Middle East when it comes to sustainability, especially in the construction industry. Maybe Cop 28 being hosted in UAE this year helps a lot. Maybe the 2030 vision of Saudi Arabia and the green Saudi initiatives helps with that as well. Also, the Qatar building. Green building initiatives in Qatar is what helps with it. So, there are a lot of improvements when it comes to them. There is a lot of push towards sustainability. Are we there yet? I don't believe so.

I think that there's a lot to be done, especially when it comes to construction. But we are ticking all the right boxes at the moment when it comes to waste management, carbon emissions during construction and when it comes to renewable energy, especially when it comes to manufacturing. There's a very huge manufacturing base here in the region. I'm talking about manufacturing in general, obviously, oil and gas being one of them. So, there is a lot of push for the industrial side of things to be a lot more sustainable. That would help modular construction once this picks up. There are a lot of developments when it comes to sustainability, but also there's a lot of room for improvement.

John McMullen

So, Robin, I'll move back to you for a moment. Besides the push for sustainability, we're also seeing a lot of new modular, high-rise buildings. We just had a 44-story in London, I think it was then they followed with a 50, which was amazing. How does high rise change the dynamic for modular buildings?

Robin Bartram Brown

It's a great question. High-rise is great. They're doing some amazing things. The architects at Vision and the crew over in the UK are really doing some incredible stuff with the high-rise that they're building. High-rise is great, but it doesn't particularly rate really to affordable housing. It's going to be more low rise. I think it's great to get some signature projects out there. I don't think it's going to be predominantly high-rise in KSA and in the region. I don't think that's where it's moving towards, but the projects that we're seeing are fantastic. What's different? Well, the connections between the mods and that can be very challenging. It's something that they've made a lot of progress on in the last five years, MEP. You have to be so much more organized with your MEP when you're going up vertically.

You've got a little bit more room for error when you're doing low rise sort of lateral stuff. I don't see high-rise as the solution for KSA. It's certainly the solution for London, New York, Singapore, where developers need to get mass and need to go vertical to get it to pay really. I think that predominantly in KSA, the market is going to be more 18 stories less. What's really interesting with high rise that we've seen in the last couple of years are these new systems now where they're starting to look towards going vertical without concrete stair cores and concrete cores. I think that's really interesting where we can start getting staircases and elevators into the mods. You literally just stack off your podium. I think that's probably where it's going to move towards, but I think we're a few years away from that really starting to develop.

John McMullen

If I understood correctly, you said it was 18 stories and lower is probably the solution for KSA.

Robin Bartram Brown

I think most of the buildings will be sub 20.

John McMullen

Just in general or are you talking about affordable housing in particular?

Robin Bartram Brown

I don't think you'll see modular in affordable housing anytime soon in KSA. I think predominantly the first type of real modular construction will be in the hospitality sector. Then that will, I think then develop out into some of the really large affordable housing projects that are looking to put out within the region.

Dr. Anas Bataw

I was going to say what helps with this really, is that you don't have to build high. A lot of the mandates, a lot of the projects that are happening in the Middle East, especially within Saudi, they build things in 1000s and millions. So, there's 1000s, 10s of 1000s of units being built by different developers so they don't have to build up. They can build across the land that they have. So, they definitely don't have to worry about, and they don't have to complicate things per se. They can just build within the projects that they have. I echo what Robin had mentioned. We don't see this conversation. I think in the past four or five years, maybe one high rise developer was playing with the idea, but they very quickly realized that this is not the option that they should go ahead with. Where a lot of the low rise, medium rise developers are taking this as a very serious option at the moment, especially within hospitality.

Robin Bartram Brown

That doesn't take away the incredible and I'll say it again, that's happening in Singapore. As well as Singapore and the UK are absolutely smashing it with high rise module at the moment. So, it's great for the industry.

John McMullen

You mentioned the scope of the work in KSA in the Middle East, which is just mind boggling in many respects how many buildings are being built, how many buildings are being planned. A question for both of you, where do you see the industry going in the Middle East and KSA in the next 10, 20, 50 years? What can we expect in terms of development? What kind of projects can we look forward to in the region?

Robin Bartram Brown

I'll start and then I'm sure Anas will finish; I think it's exciting. I think it's going to take time; I don't think that you're going to see the take up with modular happen super quickly. I think in the next five years, you'll see a couple of the major players set up factories. To do that, they need offtake agreements and then they need orders. There are some huge projects. The numbers are staggering. I think the pipelines are 200 billion, just for the next four years. I think they have enough general contractors traditionally to build 20-25% of that in country. So, they literally have to look at industrialization to deliver this, but it's going to take time. KSA doesn't move as quickly as things do in the UK or do in the US. It takes time. I see that there will be a lot of modular construction in the future. I think, as I said earlier, to start with predominantly will be the hospitality sector.

Dr. Anas Bataw

This is what we know of now. I mean, there's projects being launched every week in this region. Giga projects, not even small-scale projects. As we know from now, there's this lot of potential, there’s a lot of demand that's coming in. Yes, the supply chain is nowhere near to deliver what's on the table at the moment. Hence why we see there's a lot of discussions and a lot of effort that's been pushed towards many other methods of construction, not just modular. Modular has taken a big lead on this because of the benefits it does bring into the market.

John McMullen

Before I let you guys go, I have one last question for you. If I'm a manufacturer listening to this podcast, and developing or building or getting my product into the Middle East, piques my interest, is there any words of advice, things that a company might need to know before starting any sort of development or building project in the Middle East? Any best practices that you can think of?

Robin Bartram Brown

So, for me, I would advise that you reach out to your local government connections, your trade departments that work with those countries. Most importantly, I would reach out to make local connections with local general contractors or local suppliers or manufacturers because it's really based on relationships out there. It's all about relationships with other businesses locally. Then, explore the options, but certainly if people want introductions into projects, I'm more than happy to connect people. We all want to see it progress out there. So, you can reach out to MMY, and we will hopefully connect you with the right people that you need to speak to if you're a manufacturer that's interested. To be fair, most of them we talk to anyway, but any that haven't happened, feel free to hit our website and reach out.

Dr. Anas Bataw

To add to this, I'd say just do a lot more listening and understand the market before. It does sound very exciting, but there is a lot of things that need to be learned. It's not the same market. There's a lot of things that need to be considered. Not to scare anyone away, but there's a lot of things that need to be considered before you get into the market. A lot of listening, collaboration, get in touch with experts, such as MMY. Make sure that when you do come into the market, that you have the ultimate solution rather than just looking at it from one angle, which is manufacturing. There's a lot of players within the projects that you need to make sure that you have on board, such as the main contractor. Make sure that you have a long-term plan, where ultimately you end up setting up in the country because one of the main requirements for 2030 vision within Saudi Arabia. That's a mandate for a lot of the PIF entities is the localization. So ultimately, you need to look into ways that you can be in the long term or medium term, localized setting up in Saudi Arabia, in order to continue. It's not just a short-term involvement.

Robin Bartram Brown

Just to add and clarify. The PIF, the Public Investment Fund is the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. You've got the wealth fund, they then feed down to some development companies they own, and you may know some of these projects. The Line, Neon, all these names that people will have seen in the press, but it's linked in. So, the PIF is a sovereign wealth fund. Then they have some very large development companies that are starting to do these incredible projects throughout the region.

John McMullen

Well, thank you both Robin and Anas. I really appreciate your time today. It's been a pleasure to speak with you. I can't wait to hear more about all the projects that are being developed in the Middle East and again, I just really appreciate your time today.

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.It's Not Just a Container: Capturing the Imagination w/ Falcon Structures

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today I'm talking with Stephen Shang, founder and CEO at Falcon Structures. Stephen is here to talk about the possibilities of container-based buildings, as well as to give us an overview of his current work as the chair of MBI’s Government Affairs Committee. Stephen, thanks for being here.

Stephen Shang

Thanks for having me.

John McMullen

Tell me about yourself. What's your background? What got you interested in building with containers in the first place?

Stephen Shang

Sure, I do have quite a checkered past, John. I actually was an electrical engineer in college, as probably the only one for my class who graduated who doesn't know how to jumpstart a car. From there kind of went into high finance consulting different streams like that and was chasing.com gold out in San Francisco. In 2002, I had this eureka moment where I said, You know what, I would really like to build a real business, something that you can touch, feel, kick, you know. So, we stumbled across the idea of kind of buying shipping containers, because there's so many piled up in the ports, and renting them out for portable storage. That was my first introduction to containers.

John McMullen

Well, very cool. You do have quite a checkered past. And it seems like you have evolved a bit yourself over the course of your career. So, I'm wondering about your buildings. Tell me about how they have evolved because you've been doing this for over 20 years. I have to imagine you've learned a thing or two. How have your structures and your designs evolved now that you've been working with them for so long?

Stephen Shang

Sure. So, when we first started out, it was all about this portable storage, and we even called them storage containers. Back then nobody really knew what a shipping container was. So, they all thought we were selling Tupperware or something like that, but we listened to the marketplace. As we started getting involved with renting out portable storage containers for construction sites to store electrical gear or plumbing fixtures, we listened to the customer. Then we started getting the question, can you build us jobsite offices out of these containers? We'd love to use them. They'd be ground level, highly secure. So, we know a couple guys could help us figure that out. And so, we started figuring it out. Next thing you know, we were in the kind of job site trailer business and renting out what we call ground level offices.

Now 2008 2009 hits, and I'm sure you'll remember we had the great recession. About 67% of our customers were in the construction industry. So, we had all these containers coming back off the construction sites. We're like, oh, man, what do we do now? We've personally guaranteed all these loans to build up a huge rental fleet. How do we get ourselves out of it? So again, listened to the customer. We were approached by a group in San Antonio, actually the Air Force, and they asked us, can you build us a simulated village using these shipping containers? What kind of village and they're like, we need a Middle Eastern theater. We need to really have some way to really train our troops against IEDs, improvised explosive devices. Not knowing what it was, we're like, yeah, of course we can. Next thing you know, we're in the military training business.

After four or five years, we had built probably the largest container-based city in the US. It's a simulated city of 700 shipping containers out in the middle of nowhere in New Mexico. In 2012 to 2013, for the lessons we learned in that, again listening to our customers, we started thinking. There's probably an application for container-based structures and just general industry, not just with the military, and we were starting to develop into more of a manufacturer than just a construction company. We thought, we can take a lot of those lessons that we learned and really start manufacturing these. In 2014 2015, Falcon Structures was born. From there, we've really developed how to build cost structures using containers and build them efficiently through a manufacturing mindset.

John McMullen

That's very cool. So, you've got so many things. What's the first step in making a container building? Obviously, you need a container, but what needs to be done to that raw container before construction can begin?

Stephen Shang

Yeah, so different than traditional modular. I think you're asking about what's the first step in manufacturing, not the first step in an ideation project?

John McMullen

Well, yes.

Stephen Shang

What's different about a container-based structure is you're actually starting with a container. You have the box. In a lot of modular factories that I've heard over the years, you're starting with nothing, and you're actually building the box using either timber or you're building it with steel. With us, we bought the container, it's been used for shipping and then we're starting with that. The process is different in the sense that you're not starting from scratch. So, you get a head start in that regard. At the same time, when someone builds a floor from scratch, walls from scratch, they can build in the doors and windows. We have to cut out the doors and windows and then reinforce the container structure. So, if you cut something out of a container, it has to be stronger. You have to reinforce the structure so that it doesn't kind of fall in on itself. So, the first step is really what we call our hot works. But really, it's taking the shell in to start modifying the shell.

John McMullen

What is it about a shipping container that makes it so versatile?

Stephen Shang

I think there are a couple things about it. I'll talk about three things about the shipping container that make it more versatile. One is there's something about starting with a box versus starting with a blank sheet of paper that I believe captures the human imagination. There's a book my wife bought for my kids. It's called, It's Not Just a Box. It's about this little rabbit, who finds an Amazon refrigerator box. Next thing you know, it's a racing car. It's a burning inferno. So, it's sort of starting from nothing, we're starting with a big box. It captures, I think people's imaginations. You see a lot of applications using containers.

I've been doing this for 20 years, like you said, and I'm still amazed at some of the things that come to us to this day. In the last few years, we've seen people building swimming pools in these shipping containers. They're building vertical farms to grow crops in. They’re building wastewater enclosures. I mean, it's just limitless. I think it's because we all have that little rabbit inside of us. So that's the first part of it.

The second part of it is from a very practical standpoint. Containers are not as flexible in their dimensions as a traditional modular structure. Traditional modular, you can go 12 feet wide, 13 feet wide, 16 feet wide, if you want to. You can go you know, 53 feet long, 60 feet long, 35 feet long. With a container, you're stuck. You're stuck with a 20-foot container, or a 40-foot container. They're all eight feet wide and some of them are nine and a half feet tall. Some of them are eight and a half tall. You'll notice our tagline is think inside the box. We believe with these design constraints, that it forces you to be creative on how to use that space. Either through single wide or double wide and all that. But because you're limiting your design and discipline to that, what happens is you get much more creative ideas that come out of it. On top of that, what happens is, you can ship these containers anywhere you want in the world because they're shipping containers. There's an entire global infrastructure that's built around shipping these containers all over the world, by rail, by truck, by ship, even by airplane. So, that's the second reason I would say it's versatile.

The third and final reason. I don't know why this is we've been doing this for 20 years, but there are people out there who think shipping containers are cool. They’re kind of cool. Some people like the industrial chic look of them. Some people think you're upcycling. I mean, there's a lot of different reasons. I'm not sure if that's going to stick. I mean, it's stuck for the last 10, 15 years. Maybe that's something that comes and goes. But because they're cool, people tend to want to embrace projects with them a lot more than just traditional construction.

John McMullen

Well, industrial chic is a thing. So, you've mentioned the possibilities, this imagination that it takes to really use these containers to their full and growing potential. What are the challenges behind really building with things? I know there must be some and maybe it's just the other side of the coin working within a confined space, working within defined parameters as opposed to having that blank sheet of paper. I was wondering if you could tell us about those challenges and maybe if there's a project that you've done that was particularly challenging, and how you got through that.

Stephen Shang

Definitely the design constraints side because that is a challenge. You have to be really clever in the way that you think about these. I would say that one of the biggest challenges compared to traditional construction or even modular construction, is we are repurposing a shipping container. If you're looking at getting involved in permanent modular construction, what's one of the things you must comply with? The building codes. In 2015, when we first went down this path, the building codes didn't know what to do about containers. You had this kind of real interest in the marketplace. You had all these different building code officials around the country. It was just this patchwork of regulations that emerged. Some of it was duplicative. Some of it was conflicting. To build a container-based structure that was building code compliant was extremely difficult.

The main reason for that was these building code officials didn't know whether or not they were safe, unlike steel that you buy from the steel yard or lumber. There was no traceability on the materials because these things are usually built overseas. The question was, well, it looks like it's strong, but how do I know that it's going to withstand these kinds of forces or that the wind is not going to blow it over? They've been across the ocean, they've been field tested, but a building code official is not going to buy that. So that was one of the big challenges that we saw in 2015 when we first joined MBI. That's when I got involved with the Government Affairs Committee.

We said, how do we get containers into the building code? There's a whole long-drawn-out process on that. It was really through those advocacy efforts that led us to only 23, where containers are now in the 2021 building code. That they are being accepted by building code officials. You see much more of a proliferation of container-based structures because these barriers have been resolved.

John McMullen

So, thanks for bringing up government affairs. I wanted to switch gears to that anyway. You've been a member for a number of years, I was wondering if you could talk about sort of the mission of that committee and why it's so important beyond just containers.

Stephen Shang

Yeah, so if you look at MBI and all the all the different facets of value that it brings its membership, I believe that government affairs is one of the things that MBI does amazingly well. What do I mean by that? MBI is the voice of the modular industry, but what is that voice being used for? Lobbying, advocacy, really protecting our market, protecting our assets, but also finding new ways to use modular. I mean, these are all those things you're interfacing directly with the government or with the building code community. Somebody needs to be that collective voice in order to do that.

A manufacturer out of Austin, Texas trying to go talk to the ICC, the International Code Council, they're not going to give me the time of day. They're not going to listen to anything I have to say because I'm this little company and they're this international organization comprised of 64,000 code officials. If you have someone like MBI come in who represents the entire Modular Building Institute and they go to the ICC and say, there's this new form of construction that's happening called modular, and it's really exciting, but right now the codes aren't written very well for it. How do we really drive adoption of that by improving the codes? Well, the ICC wants to do that, and it gets the attention of the International Code Council. Then once you've got their attention, all of a sudden, you can start having conversations with building code officials saying, here's why modular isn't scary. Here's why modular is going to help you solve affordable housing in your area. This is how it's going to help you build more schools. This is how it's going to solve Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs of just having a shelter. Then suddenly, it's awesome. That's why I got involved with the Government Affairs Committee. I just see that it opens up so many opportunities for so many different companies. It's just an exciting place to be.

John McMullen

Well, we've certainly had some success with ICC. I know we've got three standards that we've published. A new one, I think, just this year. So that's very exciting.

On another note, I was wondering if you could speak to sort of the topic of the day--or the year perhaps--with our Government Affairs Committee: the Davis-Bacon Act and the problems that its expansion could bring to the industry. I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on that. How it's affecting Falcon or potentially could affect Falcon, and what it could mean for other manufacturers around the country?

Stephen Shang

Sure. Just as a recap, John, of what exactly is going on with Davis-Bacon. I think before I was involved in government affairs, if you said "Davis Bacon" to me, I probably would have said yes, please and I’ll have a side of eggs. So what Davis-Bacon is, I think it's a law or an act.

John McMullen

It's an act.

Stephen Shang

The act said that if you're working on federal job sites, you have to pay your workers what's called prevailing wages. In essence, these are union wages. It was developed 100 years ago to really protect the unions from having lower cost labor from coming in and working on these federal jobs. So, a couple of years ago, when we were in San Antonio at the World of Modular, the current administration through the Department of Labor, decided to clarify the Davis-Bacon rules. They say clarify and I'm saying these in quotes. I don't think the listeners can see me doing quotes, but it's clarifying quotes. What they did was they said that it's not just the work that's being done on site that needs to pay these prevailing wages. It's the work that's being done off site as well. So really putting a target straight on the modular industry.

If a modular manufacturer has to comply with those rules, if you're building something in New York and you have to pay the prevailing wages in New York and let's say you're in Arkansas, then all of a sudden, you're paying your guys in the factory a lot more than you ever imagined. Not only to mention the administrative burden of trying to balance that with everything else. Our estimation is that this really impacts our industry in a major way on a couple of fronts.

One, as far as just business, it's going to cause a lot of us not to want to work on federal jobs or it's going to make the pricing of these federal jobs increasingly difficult because we have to pay higher labor wages. I think the current estimate is that it would have a 20% hit on our industry going from about $12 billion a year to $10 billion a year. That's substantial and it's a huge chunk. Not to mention, this is the federal Davis-Bacon and there are a bunch of mini-Davis Bacon's that are in the different states where they mirror kind of what's happening on the federal level. Then all of a sudden, the state program is being clarified in quotes. Then they started adopting this and that starts to affect local. I don't think that $2 billion drop takes that into account. So, then you see even a bigger drop. Then it impacts the marketplace. Affordable housing becomes less affordable, schools become more expensive. So, it has this ripple effect that it really just doesn't work. What we've been working on, the Government Affairs Committee, is how to talk, how to work with the current administration and educating them that this clarification really is not beneficial for the constituents, for the citizens, but actually very detrimental on multiple levels. That's one of the things we've really been working on for the last couple of years.

John McMullen

I know MBI has done its best to sort of get the word out, we're having this conversation. I've had conversations prior with our executive director and other people about the Davis-Bacon Act and its expansion. If you're a manufacturer, or if you are in the industry, if you’re hearing this for the first time, what can people do to get involved if they want to oppose the expansion of the Davis-Bacon Act?

Stephen Shang

Yeah, definitely a great question. So, there are a couple of different ways a manufacturer can help. One is because we are all over the US. You can definitely contact your local representative, US house representative or your local senator. For the longest time this clarification was bottled up in the executive branch. Based on recent efforts, we've been able to get it to the legislative branch and the legislative branch is actually paying some attention to this. We had a couple of MBI government affairs members represent us in going to DC to talk to the different staffers that were tasked with understanding this issue. They did a great job educating them, but that's not it.

We need to educate as many representatives as we can. We need to educate as many senators as we can. Being that we're so geographically dispersed, we can actually make a difference by talking to our local guys. We are big employers in the areas where our factories are. The other way is really working with MBI with the regulatory relief fund. So, we've definitely set that up. All the members of the board have contributed to this regulatory relief fund. We've been able to use that to hire some very high-powered lobbyists in DC to help us strategize and figure out how to navigate this. That money is continuing to be spent and so contributing to that regulatory relief fund. That helps a great deal as well.

John McMullen

I think that was a great sort of Davis-Bacon in a nutshell. Thank you for that.

Switching gears just a little bit. You've mentioned this sort of bomb dropped at World of Modular. You've been at World of Modular for many years. This past year, just a month or so ago, it seems like so much longer than that ago, but it really wasn't it was a month. Can you tell me about your presentation? It had to do a lot with what we were talking about earlier with containers, with building codes. I was wondering if you could give us a gist of that presentation for those who may have missed it.

Stephen Shang

Sure. Just a plug for World of modular. We started going to World of Modular and I think it was like 2015 or 2016. It was at the Bellagio like it was this past year, but there were maybe 500- 600 people there. It was still a pretty small conference. There was some buzz, but it was like okay, this is nice. You spend some time around the pool and all that. This World of Modular 2023 was also at the Bellagio. It was just gangbusters. A1500 attendees record for MBI. There was no time to go sit around a pool. I mean, it was session after session, networking after networking. It was absolutely amazing. The energy and enthusiasm around the modular industry was just unbelievable. So, if you missed it, definitely try to make it next year for 2024’s in Orlando. It is really quite the event.

John McMullen

I’ll take the plug, thank you very much. We'll be in Orlando next year.

Stephen Shang

As far as my presentation goes, this was probably the fifth or sixth year I've given it. It was really an update on container-based structures and how to build safe container-based structures that are in compliance with the building code and all the different tools that are available out there for manufacturers and builders to use the building code to make code compliant structures. I have promised the people who have attended my presentation for the last six or seven years that next year, it'll be a little bit different, actually a lot different. It needs a refresh. We'll have new jokes; I won't be telling the same jokes over and over. It'll be some more cutting-edge stuff on container-based structures. This last presentation was really around, what's the code environment? How has it evolved? How has it embraced container-based structures?

John McMullen

Very good. Well, now that we're back on the on the container train, I have a couple more questions for you about containers. You've done a variety of projects. You mentioned earlier you built a city. You've done offices for construction sites and everything in between. Is there a potential for containers that hasn't yet been realized? Is there an idea out there that could be perfect for containers that you haven't seen done yet?

Stephen Shang

Without a doubt. I think we're just seeing the beginning of this container-based structure trend. In fact, I think we're seeing the beginning of modular as a whole. Right now, modular is only 6% of construction. That's up from two and a half percent, five, six years ago, but still growing. So, one of the things I've seen about this marketplace that's just been fascinating, is going back to that rabbit. We don't have an R&D department at Falcon where we sit around and think about, wow we could do this with a container, we can do that with a container. These ideas come from the marketplace. People come to us saying, have you ever thought about doing XYZ with a container? Fortunately for me, I have a team who is full of problem solvers. They're used to saying, let's think about that. Let's give it a try. I think there's so many uses that we have not even uncovered yet. I don't think we've seen all the ideas yet. I'm really excited about the future of this part of the industry for sure.

John McMullen

What would you tell someone who's looking to get into building with containers, who shares your enthusiasm for the industry and wants to start but really doesn't have a clue where to begin? What would you tell that person?

Stephen Shang

Yeah, so I would tell them several things. One is if you've read that Yahoo article that talks about this beautiful custom home that you can build out of $2 containers, don't believe everything you read on the internet. The cost savings aren't that dramatic. It can be good, but not necessarily. I would say first, set your expectations correctly. I would say second, there are a lot of good thinkers out there around containers, lots of good resources. Just because you can draw it on Google SketchUp, don't believe that's what you can build either.

You see a lot of container-based structures that are cantilevered in different ways, that have wide openings, and it's like, how in the world did they reinforce that? I would reach out to either a manufacturer who's been there done that or a design professional. We have quite a few members in MBI that are great design professionals that can advise as to whether or not something is practical, and whether it's constructible before you go too far down that path. Third, I would really do my due diligence on the code environment. We have made a lot of strides in that area, but just sitting down with your local building code official and saying, this is what I had in mind. What do you think and really making them included in that process. I would say those three things would be kind of the way that I would get started, just to make sure that it's worthwhile to go down this path.

John McMullen

Very good. Very good. So, what's next for you? What's next for Falcon? Are there any exciting projects on the horizon?

Stephen Shang

Yeah, we've got multiple projects on the horizon that I'm super excited about. I don't think we're going to have time to talk about all those today. Just this past year, we doubled our footprint of our manufacturing facility, continue to grow and I think it's because we're seeing the convergence of two major trends. One is the modular industry continues to grow. So, we're catching that. Then the use of containers in that part of the modular industry is awesome. We've been able to clear a lot of obstacles with building code. So, for me, what else can we do? What other projects can we take on that are fun and exciting and working with interesting people. Then on the MBI front, I'm super excited for the next several years for MBI as well. We just celebrated our 40th anniversary. Kudos to MBI. I think the next 10 years are going to be some of the most exciting years that MBI sees in its history with just the acceleration of adoption of modular construction. Also, with a lot of the technology tools that we're seeing that are coming into play, that are making them more affordable, helping people think through it better and just the sophistication of players who are in this space continues to grow at an exponential rate. So, it's just such an exciting time. I’m just really excited about what's to come.

John McMullen

Stephen, I really appreciate your time today. It's great to dive into the world of containers. Again, I think it's fascinating. I do like the industrial chic vibe. I count myself among those people who like houses designed that way. I guess I'll have to get rid of my SketchUp and it was completely empty inside. Thank you for your time today. I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the board retreat next week.

Stephen Shang

Thank you, John, for doing this. It's a lot of fun.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen. And this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.From Stress Comes Strength: Developing the Construction Workforce of Tomorrow w/ Kevin O'Connor, Host of This Old House

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm very excited to welcome Kevin O'Connor, host of the long running and Emmy Award winning television series, This Old House. Kevin is here to share his unique perspective on the advantages of off-site construction and what the industry can do to encourage and develop its next generation of workers. Kevin, thanks so much for being here.

Kevin O'Connor

I appreciate the invite John, it's my pleasure to join you.

John McMullen

So, tell me about yourself. What's your background and how did you get to become the host of This Old House?

Kevin O'Connor

My route to hosting the show is quite unconventional. My previous career was in finance. I was a commercial banker, which I started after business school. Prior to that was actually working in the legislature here in Massachusetts and the governor's office. I was always interested in construction. My father is an engineer. So, we were on his job sites growing up, making money for summer work, college breaks and stuff like that. Other construction folks in the family, I never went down that path, but I always had a passion for it.

When I first got married to my wife, Kathleen, we immediately went out and bought a two family fixer upper because it was all we could afford. We both were interested in kind of working with our hands and working on it. Having grown up as a fan of This Old House, as soon as we sort of got into this project and over our heads, we ended up for some reason writing This Old Houses’ magazine. A letter looking for some information which led to them reading it, deciding to send a camera crew out and Tom Silva to our house. We filmed a little segment for what was then a brand new show for us called Ask This Old House. Out of the blue three weeks later, I got a call and they asked me if I wanted to be the host of the shows. So it was right place, right time. No desire to be on TV. I’d never done any performing or anything like that, but was such a fan of the show and the good folks who are on it that I decided, yeah, why not? If you're going to give me the opportunity to work next to Norm Abram or Tom Silva, I'll take my blue suit off. I told my boss at the bank I’ll be back in about a year and gave it a go.

John McMullen

Wow, talk about serendipity. So, I'm a big fan of media. My background is design, multimedia, all that stuff and I love a good video production. If it's TV, commercial, film, whatever. I'm even more fascinated by what goes on behind the scenes, particularly This Old House. I wonder if you could tell me about how an episode of This Old House works? What aren't the viewers seeing that’s critical to the finished episode that we see at home?

Kevin O'Connor

Well, I'll start with a little bit of perspective. This is primarily all I do is This Old House, Ask This Old House, but I have been on some other TV shows and seen other production to know that what we do is fairly unconventional in the TV world.

In terms of how we make it, it always starts with a walk of the job site. The job site or the project dictates the outline for the episode, for the story arc of the entire series. Producers and the folks on the show gather to talk about what needs to get done, the challenges, the material that’s going to be used. That sort of creates the script if you will. It's an outline for us because we're unscripted. That sort of dictates the information that we're trying to convey.

Then on film days, it's a very lean and mean crew, we’re one camera shoot. So, we have one camera operator. Nowadays we have a sound guy, but that was not always the case. Camera was doing sound as well. We are running around basically following the action. As I mentioned at the outset, we're very unconventional from other television shows out there. Primarily because of the one camera shoot. Also, we have a legacy of sort of following the action. The host walks up to the contractor, asks a couple questions, we walk around, we point, we talk and then we work. Throughout that process, the cameraman is following us. It means that it's a lightly edited show, that there are long continuous takes and that is not conventional in television at all. We've moved away from that a little bit, but the intention was to make it as real, honest and as authentic as possible.

That natural conversation, the walking and talking about the things that we're working on and then doing the work as the cameraman sort of followed silently is our Mo. We've stuck pretty closely to it over the years. So, I think people who don't understand television may not appreciate it, but it's a very simple and it's a very organic process at creating the show.

John McMullen

Well, you mentioned how you used to not have a sound guy, the sound was taken through the camera and now you have a sound guy. I was wondering if you could talk about how the show and some of the projects that you're featuring have sort of evolved over the course of the show. You've been host for a long time now. Are there other technologies other than sound that you're making use of now that weren't either available or you didn't know to use when you began?

Kevin O'Connor

Yeah, absolutely. With the first director that I had, as the creator of the show, these are stories that he shared with me. Part of the impetus for that long continuous take is because when the show started and it was on tape, the editing process was literally cutting, taping physical video film together. As we understand, he was very frustrated with that process in the edit room of having to cut and tape all this type of stuff. So, he figured if he did long continuous takes, it would save him a lot of that. So that's sort of the origin.

Flash forward to when I started early in my career, I'll give you an example. We wanted to do a scene where Kevin arrives on the job site in the pickup truck, introduces himself in the show. As he exits the truck walks up onto the jobsite, talks to one or two of the contractors, gets inside the house, gets to the back of the house, and then finishes it with a high shot. So, to do that because this is nearly 20 years ago, we built a porch off of the side of the pickup truck. A platform welded to the side of the pickup truck that the cameraman could ride alongside me. He had to stick his camera through the window because we didn't have GoPros to stick to the front windshield. He dismounts, walking backwards while I get out of the truck. We walk together, stop, see Roger Cook our landscaper at a time, to go through the building all in one continuous take. I opened the door, walk through it, hold it with a foot so that he can get through without having to hold the door. We talked to another contractor inside, exit the house through the back. We're now at four or five minutes continuous. Then the cameraman who wants to show a high wide of the house, backs himself into a scissor lift as I continue to talk and deliver my monologue. Then an operator lifts him to the second story for the final shot. That's the way we did it back then.

Nowadays, we can put GoPros into the windshield, SLRs two or three of them in the truck. Nobody has to ride alongside. We've got drones that can get those high wide shots and we will cut that scene two or three times. We won’t bother to try to get through the door unobstructed in a continuous take. So, it's a big evolution. It's a lot of sort of nitty gritty, but the technology that's out there in terms of remoteness, smallness, things that fly all of that has helped us to make a better show and be able to do it a lot more easily than we used to.

John McMullen

That’s fascinating hearing that history. I remember coming up when I was in college, learning about tapes and cutting and editing. That digital editing was still sort of, sort of new. Lets switch gears just a little bit. I understand that This Old House has utilized modular and offsite construction for a number of its projects over the years and that you've been able to actually tour some modular factories. I was wondering if you could describe those tours and tell me what you took away from those experiences.

Kevin O'Connor

We have done that and we have toured a lot of those facilities. I'll give you a flavor just of some of the different kinds that we have toured. It's not exclusive, but we've gone to places that are very focused, where they fabricate off site one product. So superior walls, concrete foundations, for example. Concrete poured into forms in a factory setting, rigid foam insulation and aluminum studs applied there, so that they can then be lifted onto a truck and delivered to a job site. Then they can be lowered into a foundation pit. On the job site, you could end up with a higher psi concrete making a damp proof or sometimes a waterproof concrete foundation that is put together in a day. Then you've got insulation and it's ready to board on the inside. So that's sort of a focused offsite fabrication.

In addition to that, we've gone to places where they have fabricated the entire home pre cut. Where they can make all the walls and the roof parts. They can install the windows laid flat, ship it to the job site install there. We've gone to places where they are put together and trucked in their entirety, sort of more of the mobile home sort of thing where it gets craned into place. We've done them for high end timber frames, authentic historic recreations, as well as sort of quicker, more economical fast build. So, we've had the chance to sort of see it all over the years all within the residential world I would suggest. When we say not the big commercial stuff that I think maybe more of your listeners might be used to, we keep it to residential. See a wide breadth of operations.

John McMullen

I was wondering if you could tell me maybe one or two ways that you utilize offsite construction or for the show. I imagine there must be quite a few ways on any given production to save time and save costs. I wonder if you could just give a few examples.

Kevin O'Connor

We went down to New Jersey after superstorm Sandy and we worked on three homes that were damaged. One was a cottage; it was more of a conventional renovation. Another one was sort of a home from the 80s where we lifted an entire story and were able to put helical piles underneath it. The third house was too far gone and it had to come down. So, our contractors, Early Homes, given both the labor shortage but also an acute shortage caused by all of the houses that were damaged from superstorm Sandy, went and they ended up having houses built off site and craned into place so that they were put together in about a week's time. So that's sort of one example of how we've used modular construction to accelerate the building process, but also to get us resources that we couldn't otherwise get. A home that was manufactured I believe in Pennsylvania where the resources were not interrupted in terms of manpower, as well as materials. And you couldn't find materials or manpower in the New Jersey area, because 10s of 1000s of people were doing the exact same thing at the exact same time. So that's just one example. We've done it for custom high-end homes. We've done it for parts and components for renovations and restorations and such. That's pretty much across the board.

John McMullen

Well, you mentioned the labor shortage, in particular to Sandy, but I want to put a pin in that. I want to come back to that in just a minute. You've been on more construction sites than I can probably count and seen just about every different way to build or rebuild a home. In all of these projects, and you alluded to some of these in your response just now, what's the biggest benefit to utilizing off site or modular construction from your point of view?

Kevin O'Connor

In our world, I think the single biggest benefit is time. So, we can accelerate the timeframe of a project and that's beneficial to the contractor for a variety of reasons. If the foundation can go up in a day or so then he doesn't have his crew dedicated to say three or four weeks. Or he doesn't have subcontractors building forms there for 10 days, putting them up taking them down. So, it accelerates the project. Acceleration of time for contractors who are in our business is key because it allows them to increase the workflow over the course of the year. Maybe they could complete 12 projects instead of 10, which is always good. So, time is probably the number one factor and close behind it is precision. There are things that you can do off site, you can get a higher quality, you can get a better quality on the job site. I go back to the superior walls, but it's not the only example. You can get a stiffer, more damp proof wall because of the way they cure the concrete in the factory. You can get a higher R value these types of things. So, we use it for timing certainly, but we also use it for improved quality.

John McMullen

So here's the question for you. We've talked about new technologies that you've incorporated into your show, new technologies that have been advantageous to the projects that you feature on your show. Why can't the greater construction industry sort of do the same? Why is it sort of stuck where it has been for decades upon decades?

Kevin O'Connor

Well, I think it's complicated. I certainly don't have all the answers. I thought about it a lot. In my mind in the residential construction business that we're familiar with, I would say that the number one limiting factor is the size of these companies. They tend to be very small, very geographically focused. There's a couple stats that I just keep in my mind to help paint this picture. There are roughly 600,000 construction companies in the country and a full quarter of them have one individual. It’s a sole proprietor, single fabricator type of construction company obviously using subs, but think about that. If you bump that number up to 20 or fewer employees, which is kind of the definition of a small company, that percentage exceeds 90%. So, across the industry, they're very small companies focused on a very limited geographic focus and I think size limits your ability to innovate. I think size limits your ability to access resources, whether it's off-site construction, the materials you need, or the latest technology. I think it's an inhibitor to recruiting. So again, it is complicated.

I think there's more than just one thing, but I think the small size of these companies is what constrains the productivity and their ability to innovate. If I could go a little further, productivity in the construction industry as a whole is generally been flat since the end of World War Two, on a year over year basis. That's pretty damning to the industry when you think about things like agriculture or manufacturing, where their productivity has increased over 1500% by comparison. It paints a very blunt picture. If you were to take the construction industry and then start to bifurcate. What you see is that the smaller construction companies are stagnated when it comes to productivity. By comparison, the larger components of the construction industry and the industrial side, some of the larger manufacturing, you end up getting a 20 to 40% increase in productivity in construction compared to the smaller companies. I think that sort of reinforces my thinking that size is an inhibitor to these things.

John McMullen

Is there anything the industry can do about that? I know we can't tell every sole proprietor, "Hey, go hire more people, rent a section of a factory, and start automating." That's not realistic. Is there anything that the industry or the small companies within the industry can do? Whether it be commercial or residential, that they could do to increase their productivity and make use of these newer technologies that are now at our disposal?

Kevin O'Connor

Well, I wouldn't dismiss growth. I do think growth is important to growing the size of the company. I have a wonderful mentor, Ted Benson from Bensonwood, who does a lot of timber framing and now off-site construction, a very high-quality home top of his trade. He and I have spoken many times, he knew he had to grow his company in terms of manpower, throughput number of jobs, so that that growth could support him creating a factory floor. Him buying top German CNC machines that get some of the work done. So, I think growth needs to be part of that equation.

To your point, a lot of people go into this because they want to be sole proprietors, or they want to run small businesses. It's a family business. I don't have any expectations that they are going to change the size of their companies just in pursuit of productivity. So, the solution for them lies in part, I think, with embracing the technology and productivity that's coming their way because of the sophistication of manufacturers. There are a lot of manufacturers who are solving the problem for the small contractors. It's a simple example, but I use it a lot. I think about the sheathing that we use on residential construction and renovation right now. The Huber products, zip sheathing where you have not just the traditional sheet of plywood, if you will. Not just a traditional sheet of sheathing, but then you have the water-resistant barrier in there, the protection against air infiltration. So, several steps have been reduced to a single step in many cases. The manufacturer is the one who innovates and brings that innovation and hopefully that productivity to the smaller contractor if they will go out and embrace those materials. Whether it is ICF forms, insulated concrete forms, that a carpenter can now put up the forum for a foundation wall. A quick pour gives them not just a foundation, but a doubly insulated wall. These types of things.

So, to me, if you can't grow, then you should reach for the products that are coming from the large manufacturers where innovation has been developed by them and embedded in these products to hopefully speed up your jobsite. We've got a company that we worked with recently that does prefabricated exterior trim. So, you literally give them your window order cut sheet. Now they have the size of every single window that you're putting into your house. What they will do is they will deliver to you the exterior trim with the head casing, side casings, sill, apron, and all that put together. It's higher quality, it's out of the right materials and more importantly, the small contractor isn't sending a laborer around the house two or three times and up and down two stories to trim out 20 or 40 windows with individual cuts. So that level of embracing innovation from fabricators I think is a great way for smaller companies to improve their productivity.

John McMullen

Excellent. Thank you. I'd love to talk to you about your experiences with construction crews and experts you've worked with around the country. I know we put a pin in that labor shortage comment you made earlier, I'm going to pull that pin right now. There have been scores of talented people that you've worked with over the years. The crews that you interview on your shows, the contractors that you talk with, it's always fascinating for me to see them work because they're so good at what they do, particularly when there's a camera on them. I see these people and they're doing a great job. There always seems to be enough people doing the jobs that you're featuring yet there seems to be some kind of disconnect within the industry. Why? I know there's an overwhelming need for more trades people in the industry at every turn. What's the disconnect in your opinion? Why are there not more people coming into the industry? Why is there such a lack of new interest in the trades and how do we change that?

Kevin O'Connor

Again, I think it's complicated. I think there are a lot of answers to the question. In my mind, it starts with money. So, across the board, at least within residential construction, entry level and mid-level wages are below the national averages. I think young people make rational decisions. When you take them as a group, they make pretty rational decisions. They look at what else is available out there and there are a lot of jobs, I'm not suggesting that they're necessarily fulfilling jobs, great jobs, or whatever. But there are a lot of jobs that provide higher pay, better benefits and, you could argue more comfortable working conditions. When you look at the list of things that folks, when surveyed, young people know they want to have meaningful work. They want good pay, that's always top of the list, but then they want meaningful work, impactful work, and they want a path to advancement. So that path to advancement requires training, exposure to technology, mentorship, all these types of things. The construction industry on the residential side, generally is low barriers to entry. There's lots of physical manual labor, that can be done by a lot of people. That low barrier to entry, I think, keeps wages down. Which is why I don't think advancing the technology or the skill level within the trade should be something that people should be threatened by. I think they can actually lift wages, but right now, they tend to be lower.

I do believe that the physical nature of the job is an inhibitor to a lot of young people. In fact, there's a list of what they want when they're looking for a job. There’s also a list of what they don't want when they're looking for a job. The first thing that's typically on the don't want is hard physical labor. I think the construction industry has a pricing problem and I also think it has a work approach problem. Now that being said, I do think it's a great place for young people to go into. I think there are a lot of benefits that it can offer. It's not all about how do I make the most money. You couldn't pay me any amount of money to be a marketer or an engineer at Facebook, I just couldn't do it. It doesn't matter how sexy the job sounds, or how much money or the benefits or whatever. So, there is room for this, but I do think that the industry has got those two problems. Too low pay, too hard work, manual work mind numbing work, and I think there are ways to improve that but those are big hurdles to overcome.

I think the industry has to look inward, there is a cultural message as well. We have glorified the college education and I think that we have sort of poo pooed some of these other jobs. We've heard this argument before. I think there's a measure of truth to it, but I think it's sort of singularly dimensional. I don't think it's the only reason. I do feel like that pendulum is sort of starting to swing back another way. I do think that when there's a national discussion about whether or not we have to forgive a trillion dollars worth of college debt, it really wakes you up to the idea that says, why is there so much to begin with? I think that pendulum is swinging back. I saw a stat recently that when it comes to over the past decade, college enrollment is down 15 whereas apprenticeships at existing companies is up 50%. I think that's an indication of the pendulum sort of starting to swing. Employers realizing the college degree is not giving them everything that they need in their young people and then leaning into doing the apprenticeship so that they can train themselves, but also more young people having the courage to say, college is not for me. There's no shame in that and go into these other industries such as construction.

John McMullen

Well, that was a fascinating statistic, I hadn't seen that. Of course, you're speaking with some knowledge of this particular segment of the industry. I know that through This Old House, you have been working hard on a Generation Next initiative, which is a feature on many of the episodes. I wonder if you could talk about that program, what its goal is and what have you been able to accomplish with it?

Kevin O'Connor

Generation Next is This Old House’s attempt to show the audience that going into the trades is not only a respectful and an honorable thing to do, but also can be a lucrative thing to do and a very fulfilling thing to do because it can provide you with a career. I will say that it is primarily about messaging. We are not affecting a lot of young people. What we do is we go out; we find young people who are thinking about coming into the trades and letting them be apprentices on our job sites and profile their journey on the show. We're not touching a lot of lives immediately because we only have a few apprentices who come through it every year. The messaging is important to us because we have a wide audience. We're hoping that both parents and young people see that these kids are out there not necessarily having to acquire college debt and are potentially on the path to a fulfilling and lucrative career. So, for us, it's trying to tell that story and calling attention to both the shortage of labor in the trades, but also the potential for people who think about going into it in terms of his success. We are one voice amongst many voices who have done a very good job of telling this story and delivering this message. So, it's impossible for me to gauge how successful we've been or not. We've had great feedback, nothing but positive comments. Again, I think we're just one of many voices who have been delivering this message.

John McMullen

Are there lessons that modular and offsite manufacturers can take from what you've learned? What can they be doing? What can they be doing to attract and develop new talent?

Kevin O'Connor

That's a really good question. I feel as if the folks on your side are better at it than sort of the folks on our side of the residential construction. I guess if I had to say one thing, I would call people's attention to they need to start early. Decisions are being made by these young people at a very early age. I have a high school senior right now. He's my oldest, two younger than him in middle school. The conversation about what are you going to do after graduation? It started sophomore year, maybe freshman year. That kind of thought process are you college bound? Are you trades bound? Are you some other industry bound? That's something that happens at 14 years old. They're extremely young, that process starts at a very young age.

As we've gone out and tried to look for apprentices to join us on the jobsite, the first reaction that we all have is my goodness, they're really young. They're high school, where are they going to live? Who are they going to stay with? That is when the thought process is happening, when those decisions are being made for many of these people. So, I guess that's the one sort of takeaway that that I've seen from it, which is start young. Decisions are being made at young ages. So, start young, get your message to them, make it clear, make it appealing to somebody of that age. I think it should reap some rewards for attracting folks into this industry.

John McMullen

So as a father, and I have a stepson who's a senior in high school, and as a professional in the industry, what's your pitch to young adults, to recent graduates be at high school or college who are considering their options? Why should they consider work in the trades?

Kevin O'Connor

That's a great question. A couple of things. First of all, I do believe you have to do what you like to some extent. We all have to do things we don't like. In general, we've got to be in a field that we're excited about. If working with your hands, being on a job site, or working in a field where there are tangible results that you see at the end of every day, then embrace that and know that that's sort of who you are. There are careers out there that can scratch that itch.

The second thing that I say to these folks is, to me I need to be doing things. I need to be active; I need to feel like I'm making a contribution. I believe that this industry of building, of construction, of transformation, is one of the best ways to get that done. As opposed to being in a queue, in front of a computer or these types of things. I think it needs some gussied up, but I think that's a great place to be. The biggest thing that I tell the kids is in terms of your financial security, this offers a great opportunity because you don't necessarily need to borrow money to go into debt for the higher education. You can get started right away and get ahead of other folks in terms of years on the job and earning potential. To me, the most exciting thing is that if you're good at it, in very short order, you can be your own boss. You can run the business; you can own your small contracting company at a young age. When I was at the bank, I was not going to own the bank, it was not going to happen. If you want to be an independent businessperson, if you want to own your own company, if you want to have a lot of control over your career, your earnings, who you work with, and what you do, this is a phenomenal opportunity to get all of those things done. I think that excites a lot of young people.

John McMullen

Where do you see the industry in 10 years? What are your hopes for people coming into the industry? People already in the industry? Where are we in 10 years?

Kevin O'Connor

I'm not sure we're anywhere different than where we are now. Sadly, it is a big stone to move. I am hopeful that as a whole, we raise our standards. That the level of work becomes more rewarding and impactful, less physical. That there's more comingling of physical talents as well as mental skills where we embrace technology. I think all those things will bring more people into the field, which I think can only help us. I do think that we've got some sort of systemic problems in terms of not able to build enough homes for a growing population and not being able to build enough houses in areas that are growing very fast, whether they're all moving to Denver, or the southeast, or whatever. I think those constraints have the potential for breaking some of these habits and causing this industry to embrace different types of construction. Those are the only types of construction that will be able to build quickly and in large volume and at high qualities.

So, from stress comes strength. My hope is that some of the things that are straining our industry right now will also be the things that help us to break free to become stronger, and to become better at sort of what we do in terms of productivity, in terms of wage growth. In terms of making this a more attractive industry for young people to look at.

John McMullen

Very good. Last question. What's next for you? Are there any big projects on your horizon?

Kevin O'Connor

The next thing for me is a lot of the same of what I've been doing. This Old House through and through so we'll continue making the two shows. We as a company continue to evolve. We're very pleased to announce actually today, May 25, that we're dropping a new television show. We're owned, our parent company is Roku. So we've got a beautiful show where we collaborated with a nonprofit volunteer organization called Team Rubicon. It's a veteran led organization that goes in and around the country after storms to help clean up, to rebuild, to assist our neighbors, people who have had a really bad day because their homes have been destroyed or damaged. We're releasing that series today. Personally, and our company is in the world of building but also storytelling. We're going to continue to make more shows about what we've already done, new shows like Team Rubicon and others like those where we can celebrate building people actually working, making changes and impactful things in our lives. So I think the future for me is more of what we do and make it better every year as we go forward.

John McMullen

Very exciting. Very exciting. So, if people are interested in watching Team Rubicon, where's that? Where's that found?

Kevin O'Connor

Thank you for that good point. It is streaming as of today on Roku. So, you can get the Roku box, the Roku stick. Or if you have a smart TV, you can download the app. Roku is free streaming. There's no cost so anyone can watch it. All the episodes drop and people can binge on them if they want.

John McMullen

Thank you, Kevin. I really appreciate your time. I know you're an exceptionally busy guy. I appreciate your insights and the experiences that you've shared. Thank you very much.

Kevin O'Connor

It's been my pleasure and as I said before, thank you for the invite.

John McMullen

My name is John McMullen, and this has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.A Future in Fiberglass: New Frontiers for Modular Construction w/ Futuro Houses

John McMullen 

Hello and welcome to Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction, brought to you by the Modular Building Institute.

John McMullen 

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen. I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm happy to welcome Anthony Corpora, CEO of Futuro Homes. Anthony is here to talk about his company's unique product offerings and the future of prefabricated housing. Anthony, thanks for being here.

Anthony Corpora

Thank you much appreciate it. I'm excited to be here.

John McMullen

I am, too. So, tell me about yourself, Anthony. What's your background and how did you become the CEO of Futuro Homes?

Anthony Corpora

So, I had a pretty vast experience working for a great public school system in Northeast Ohio. I became a middle management coordinator, and I developed the urge to really pursue leadership and management as my master's degree, and was kind of set to get into some heavy administrative roles. So, I do have a pretty collaborative background and influential background, I've worn many hats in the public sector. And lo and behold just through relationships and interest, I took an early retirement of 21 years, and moved into this role as the CEO of Futuro Houses. It was great because once you see opportunity and what drives a leader to be stimulated this, I knew this was the slam dunk for me. I'm not saying the public school sector was not it, but when you look at an opportunity of a lifetime, it was just too good to pass up.

John McMullen

So, tell me about Futuro Houses itself as a company. I did a lot of research before the show, and I found an old 60s era kind of UFO house. It didn't seem directly related to what you're doing. But then I was obviously looking at your website and they're very similar. Is there a connection between the two?

Anthony Corpora

There is. If I can give you a little bit of background on the company. Futuro Houses is a subsidiary of US Lighting Group, which is a publicly held OTC Markets company. To make a long story short, the company went moving into a new space into the fiberglass world. We were in the electronics business, we decided to get into the fiberglass business to create a molded fiberglass travel trailer company. That's where I came on board trying to create something grand. You need to build a team around you. So, I was put in place to lead the efforts, lead the coordination, and build the ultimate team to pursue the vision of what Cortes Campers will bring and what it's bringing to the RV industry.

The core competency behind that was fiberglass. We have our engineers, and our technicians are very well versed in fiberglass. They were also in the boat building industry. So, to make a long story short, as you're looking at the overall picture of US Lighting Group and getting into diversified markets, we obviously know the RV space is growing. What we're bringing to the RV world is amazing. We also felt that we could do the same into the housing industry because right now nobody builds houses out of fiberglass. So obviously it's a great way to diversify the company portfolio and to dive into another multibillion-dollar market. So, we are taking the same innovation and success of what's making Cortes Campers successful and putting those same core competencies into Futuro Houses. Lo and behold, started researching houses. Then we came across the original Futuro from 1968 of the world famous Matty Cernan. Then what happened was we go further into the house, what was created and the influence that had all over the world. We said, this is where we need to start. We obviously looked at some of the shortcomings of the house, we decided how we could improve it, hence, the creation of our first UFO house, as we call it. We've totally re-engineered the house. That's kind of where we started. So, it was kind of a steppingstone to get here. Obviously, the vision of the company is we started with this house because it will definitely grab the attention of the world which we've been successful at and then we have houses to come.

John McMullen

Very good. I have to say I love this house. I love the original from 68 and you've modernized it. It looks a little sleeker, a little bit more 21st century but it's still got this great sense of fun and whimsy. It's definitely an attention-grabbing house. I was wondering if you could tell me more about the house itself. It's made of fiberglass as you mentioned, but how was it produced? How was it put together? What improvements did you make over the original?

Anthony Corpora

So, a couple of things that we do from our core competency of how we build things is we don't use any wood in any of our construction. That's a core competency of Cortes Campers and it overlaps. It's the same with Futuro Houses. So, if you see some of the old pictures, you'll see their renovations, and pictures of just a lot of wood. Obviously, you'll see rotted wood, molded wood and decayed wood. So, our recipe here for success is to build something with the highest-grade marine materials that you can buy in the industry to give you a product that's going to last a lifetime.

Number two, it will look amazing because of the gloss and what our composites bring to the industry are far superior. Then we go further to realize that the original Futuro house had some shortcomings. The first one is it was not easily shipped. You’ll see a lot of old pictures and a lot of them were flown in by helicopter or hauled in by a super oversized semi-truck. So, I don't have too many friends with helicopters and it's very expensive to haul with an oversized flatbed. So, then we decided to further make the product easily transportable by making it in smaller parts. So, our house, there's 36 pieces. There’s 12 on the top, in the middle, on the bottom, and it will fit in a standard shipping container. That was also a part of our charge.

We are planning on shipping internationally. Eventually, we also came across at the original Futuro house, the windows didn't open. I don't know if I'd ever want to be in a house where the windows didn't open. So, we decided to again go another step farther to give a great double pane acrylic window to the industry, one that will open. We came up with a shape because it was depending on how it would fit the container. The house is actually bigger than the original. We went from 26 feet in diameter to 30 feet in diameter. So, we now have a bigger footprint than the original and it really elongates it. I think it looks even, more UFO flying saucer than the original just because we have elongated the house to 30 feet. So those are some of the you know some of the main takeaways and what we're doing different. Zero wood, exceptional high end marine composites. Then if you see our base, some of our renderings, and what we've shown it the ix Center, our base is quite different. It looks a little bit more techie UFO and it will also break down into parts that will fit in a container. So that was part of our success, as making this easily attainable to get to the consumer with easy shipping.

John McMullen

Well, I do hope you continue to offer the helicopter delivery for those who want it. It seems entirely appropriate to have your spaceship flown in.

Anthony Corpora

Yeah, there are some people that may want to do a special request. So, there are basically no limitations to what we could do here for Futuro Houses. So, we will make it happen and we will find the media there to videotape it.

John McMullen

Very good. Speaking of delivery, whether it be by truck or air, or however else, as I understand it, the house can be placed just about anywhere. Are there zoning issues or code issues that you've encountered that maybe your customers need to be aware of?

Anthony Corpora

Right, so right now we're developing a dealer network across the United States and Canada. We're working with our dealers and they're getting up their websites. You'll see our dealer in Montana already has the website up. We have Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, so we are establishing a dealer network. It will be their responsibility to intimately work with the consumer on the area where the house will be built. Some areas, as you know, don't have any codes and regulations. Some have a lot of them. We feel obviously with the construction, composites are stronger than steel. We can make this laminate any strength we want it to be. So, there are basically no limitations. Obviously, if you're looking in places in Montana where you're going to need 60 pounds per square foot of snow. In Alaska, I think we're upwards of 150 pounds per square foot. So, we can work that out with our engineers and make sure that we may change the laminate a little bit but we can make a house to put basically anywhere in the US.

John McMullen

Well tell me about the off grid living options for this house. I was looking at your website and that was a big feature that could not only be placed anywhere, but in any sort of range of modern electronics or amenities, correct?

Anthony Corpora

Correct. Yep. Right now, we're selling shell kits. As we're working on the interior, this thing will be able to look on the grid or off the grid. It will have wind, solar, it will collect rainwater. So, you could basically put this anywhere. You could put it in terrain, doesn't have to be on a slab. Obviously, depending on where you're going to put it, you may have to comply with some of the zoning. A lot of people will put these where there is no zoning, put them on rock structures, level them off with bricks, and to some places where you may have to hike and get to it. It's almost to the imagination of the consumer. A lot of people want to use these for Airbnb opportunities. So, that also will give a unique experience, I think there's going to be a following in the United States have unique futuros all over the country. You'll see like thumbtacks, and stickers on people's refrigerator of where they've gone and have an agenda of which ones, they want to see this summer. So, it's going to be really cool.

John McMullen

So, from what I've heard, your houses are very customizable depending on your customer's needs, which makes me think about your factory. Can you tell me a little bit about that and how that's evolved since you first started? What processes are you using now that maybe you weren't when you started?

Anthony Corpora

Correct. So, we have actually had the original, we call it a fiberglass plug. We knew that this thing had to be perfect. So, we have fast fiberglass and tooling experience, but you could never beat the accuracy and efficiency of a router. So, we outsourced once we had this engineered in SolidWorks. We had it outsourced to a tremendous tooling company in Michigan. They created the plug. So, obviously when we make the molds and make the parts they fit perfectly, and it looks great. So, we outsourced all of that. What we're doing right now is continuing to make tooling so that we can gear up for mass production. Basically, you grow and scale and fiberglass, not so much by more people, it's creating more molds. So, it's kind of like a baker and his bread pans. You could make more loaves of bread if you have more pans and that's kind of the same in fiberglass.

So right now, we have about a 30,000 square foot building. So obviously we make campers as well, through Cortes Campers, which is a subsidiary company of Futuro. We also now are going to grow and expand Futuro Houses by making more, we call them pipe piece molds, which are the top, the bottom and the window molds, which will be the centerpiece. So, once we have multiple multi reach, then we can very easily grow, scale and make the houses to meet the dealer demand and the consumer demand.

John McMullen

Well, it sounds like you've been drawing on a tremendous amount of material knowledge and experience. This sounds like it's been a relatively easy process, but there must have been some sort of challenge that you've overcome along the way. I was wondering if you could maybe dive into that a little bit? What has been that challenge and how did you overcome it?

Anthony Corpora

You know, there's always challenges of starting a company. This just didn't happen overnight. This was years in the making. So, we just didn't have this idea a couple of weeks ago and launch this thing. This has been years. So obviously, just like any startup company, finding the capital for r&b and getting everything in process. Obviously, being publicly held helps with US Lighting Group, but it's getting the idea, doing a lot of the research of making sure that it's going to be a success. So, there's been a lot of time taking in that sense, understanding the market, and what's going to make this work. So, there were all kinds of challenges, but once you bring the team around you from our lead engineer, who is really the mastermind behind all of this, and the team, we're working on marketing efforts, it becomes very easy when things roll together. So obviously, we have huge plans for Futuro Houses in general, not just with the futuro house, but with a lineup of houses. So obviously, though we have huge expansion plans for all of our lineup, and then to the production of what we're going to bring to market. It's going to be amazing and it's going to just keep growing.

John McMullen

I have no doubt. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about fiberglass specifically. Not only for uniquely shaped houses like Futuro makes, but do you think there's a potential for fiberglass in other types of construction? We talk a lot on this show about commercial modular construction. Tall buildings, workforce housing, all types of structures. Can fiberglass be utilized for those types of things, in your opinion?

Anthony Corpora

Absolutely. Fiberglass is probably one of the ways of the future. If you look at what fiberglass brings to the industry versus wood, I'm picking fiberglass any day of the week. You can see in the IBC codes and all that they're actually starting to have a denims for things like things outside of the woods spectrum. So you're saying that fiberglass brings a lot of benefits from cosmetic to futuristic, but from a long lasting and even structural. It's going to gain momentum.

John McMullen

You mentioned at the top of the show you're able to fit futuro houses into a container for easy shipping, which makes a lot of sense. What have you learned about not only the logistics side of this, but the manufacturing? The shipping? How have you sort of optimized your process as you've gone along?

Anthony Corpora

It starts with our dealers doing their marketing efforts and gaining the consumer sales, which we're starting to get orders right now. Then obviously, it's just that communication of lead times getting to the consumer. So, they can get everything done on the forefront to gain their permits. So, it's just about communication with lead times, getting everybody on the same page, and lamination for us is very easy. That's what we do. That's our bread and butter. We design cool products and we make cool products. I have guys in the back with anywhere from 20 to 40 years experience in fiberglass and composite. So, these guys can do this in their sleep. Once you have everything standardized and laid out, it's just like riding a bicycle. So, this is what their true passion is and that's what we're all about. So just again, meeting the demand for the product.

I don't know if we'll ever get there because that means you have a cool product and hopefully we'll never have inventory and there will always be a lead time. So, that's one of our goals here. We're doing some really cool things with our dealers right now. Not so much on the UFO futuro but our 200 and 300 house that you can see on our website. We're looking to dive into some of the homeless rehabilitation acts that the privately funded and government funded monies are going towards. So, we're working with our dealers now to work on getting our houses to those people just because we bring the quality and indestructibility to the industry. So, it fits real well with their model.

John McMullen

You anticipated my next question. I was going to ask about other projects that Futuro was working on. Can you tell me a little bit more about these houses? It seems like a great use of materials and your dealer network to solve or at least put a dent in what is a huge housing crisis.

Anthony Corpora

Yes, correct. So, we started obviously with the futuro UFO house to grasp the attention of the world and we've done that. That is a higher price, that's a niche product. A lot of people want to use those for that entrepreneur opportunity to rent them out. Some people still want to live in them, but then we decided to produce in volume. Price point means everything, so we decided to bring smaller houses to the industry. We have what's called a 200, 300, or 400. It's obviously from 200 square feet to 400 square feet and they're all unique in nature. It's similar to how we build the campers. Everything is fiberglass, it's all molded in, we're using the same appliances, and what we're putting into our campers. It's really a seamless transition to go into this market after your tooling and the design are done because the lamination is basically the same.

So, it's real easy to just get into having more products, which will obviously excite the consumer base. Then you could do some humanistic things just to keep your karma bank recharged by doing some really nice thing for disadvantaged and homeless acts rehabilitation acts out there. So that's emerging and looking like they're these states and cities adopting models of what they've done in Texas. Their homeless population is going down and they're just looking for a really good product out there. So, it's grasping the attention of our dealers and grasping the attention of the decision makers to get our units out there on the property for these efforts.

John McMullen

That's excellent. I was wondering if you could speak to the potential, outside of providing structures for homeless or houseless people, what's the potential for off grid premanufactured homes just in general? Do you anticipate seeing more home seekers and homebuyers turning to options like either the UFO house which I know is a niche product, but fiber fiberglass houses in general, to be their primary house?

Anthony Corpora

Absolutely. People are using these for extra income, but I believe this will also start the craze to be either on the grid or off the grid with structures that are longer lasting and cheaper. Everything is about price point, so we bring a huge advantage to the market. On top of it, we also have consumer financing. Now that we have financing with consumers who are creditworthy, you could take a 25 year mortgage, that's really reasonable on any one of our products. So, there are a lot of advantages right now. I believe this has been a trend. We went to the Home and Garden modeling show and you can see all the neat things that are going on there. There's a lot of people out there making cool products and I think it's a trend that will continue to emerge. I think futuro houses just brings something to the industry that right now nobody brings, which is fiberglass. So we have a huge advantage, but hats off to everybody else that are doing similar things to what we're doing.

John McMullen

Well, Anthony, this has been fascinating. I really appreciate your time today. Thank you so much. I can't wait to see Futuro take off as a company.

Anthony Corpora

John, thank you very much. I had a great time talking with you today and looking forward down the road. If you need to talk in the future, just come find me.

John McMullen

Will do. There's a dealer in Virginia. I'm in Virginia, I may well visit.

Anthony Corpora

Excellent. She's amazing. We've signed her on a couple of weeks ago. She definitely brings a lot to the table. So we’ll get you in touch with her.

John McMullen

Excellent. My name is John McMullen. This has been another episode of Inside Modular: The Podcast of Commercial Modular Construction. Until next time.[Podcast Intro]
Speaker 1: Hello and welcome to Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction brought to you by the Modular Building Institute. Today's episode is also brought to you by the now-virtual Off-Site Construction Expo, sponsored by MBI. Visit offsiteconstructionexpo.com today to join industry speakers, exhibitors, and attendees for the first virtual expo of 2020 on September 16th and 17th. Now, everyone can attend for only $199. That's offsiteconstructionexpo.com. Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Nick Gomez, Studio Director at Lowney Architecture. Nick is here to talk about designing for modular projects. Nick, thanks for coming on today.

Nick Gomez: Hi, John. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1: It is my pleasure. Tell me about Lowney Architecture and how you got started in modular design.

Nick Gomez: Sure. I joined Lowney Architecture six years ago. When I joined, at the time, Lowney Architecture was predominantly doing about 70% retail work and about 30% housing. Through a connection with a friend of Ken Lowney, the principal who started Vida Communities, we started doing our first modular projects.

Speaker 1: Is there anything in particular that drew you to modular?

Nick Gomez: Yeah. I had been doing affordable housing for 15 years prior to joining Lowney Architecture, and some of that work included K-12 work. I was really aware of working with third-party regulatory review agencies on the K-12 projects. I was also doing housing. So, it was kind of a perfect match for doing modular projects here in California that require a third-party regulatory review through the State of California. Doing affordable housing, I was always looking at how to make efficient buildings. You need to bring buildings in on budget. So, understanding the regulatory review process was a perfect match for modular construction, and it's something I was really interested in.

Speaker 1: That's awesome. I know affordable housing is a big issue everywhere, particularly in California, but even here in Virginia, we're dealing with that a lot. Kudos to you. That's great. What is the architect's role on a modular project?

Nick Gomez: The architect's role can vary depending on the project structure. Initially, when I first started, Gerdan and ZETA would typically hire the architect who was doing the state sets. Sometimes our role was to work with the factory. However, we've moved away from that role model now. The factories prefer to work with the owner. In our current role, we're more the ring leader of the project. We still have to produce state sets for the factory and communicate everything back through the team to the contractor who will install the project at the end. There's a lot of coordination we have to do, particularly between the factory work and the site work.

Speaker 1: Are there any other members of the team with whom you work more closely than others, like the engineers, on-site installers, or the factory staff? Is there a particular relationship that's more suited for architecture?

Nick Gomez: We work with the entire team, but because these projects are very engineering-based, we do work a lot with structural engineers. They tend to be the ones who are addressing structural issues that may come up during the factory construction. So, the structural engineer is the person I have to talk to regularly on these projects. We work with the entire team, but structural engineers tend to be the ones we work most closely with.

Speaker 1: Is designing for modular very different than designing for a traditional stick-built structure, and if so, how?

Nick Gomez: Yes, they are very different. You're not only stacking things in the vertical direction with your shear and your mate walls, but you're also aligning things in the horizontal direction. On top of that, you have design parameters to maintain for shipping, such as heights and lengths. You need to consider these constraints in the 3D design of the building to make it lay out properly. Modular design is structurally different. You're repeating things as much as possible to maximize factory production. While it's different, it allows for efficient construction.

Speaker 1: When you're learning how to be an architect, this is not something that's taught. Was there a learning curve in designing for modular buildings? Did you have to rethink how you had done things in the past and come up with something new?

Nick Gomez: There was a learning curve, especially when we started collaborating with factories. Early on, we would get projects, and it was like, "They can't build this project. Let's see if we can modularize it." We learned how to divide the project into modules that made the building. Doing that multiple times helped us learn. I was interested in making efficient buildings from my early experience in affordable housing, so adapting to modular construction wasn't too challenging.

Speaker 1: What do traditional architects need to know before trying their hand at modular?

Nick Gomez: In California, with the dual regulatory review process, architects need to understand that they'll have two sets of documents: one for the state and one for the local jurisdiction. Clear scope separation between the two is crucial. There's a lot of coordination between the factory and site work, and architects need to be aware of where the factory work stops and the site work begins. Collaboration is essential.

Speaker 1: Has the pandemic affected your work in the past few months?

Nick Gomez: Personally, no. I'm busier now than I was prior to the pandemic. Most of our projects are affordable housing and were deemed essential, so they didn't stop. We even had some projects start during the pandemic. The factories we work with are in production because they were working on affordable housing projects. We're still busy, and there's a continued need for housing.

Speaker 1: That's great to hear. I've been hearing similar things from others. Is there an interesting or exciting project you're working on now?

Nick Gomez: We're getting ready to start stacking the Mayfair project in El Cerrito. It's a prominent location near a BART station, and it features a large art component. The project has an angled façade, and it's quite unique. It's challenging, but it's going to look beautiful once it's done.

Speaker 1: That sounds exciting. I'd love to see pictures of it. Thank you, Nick, for your time today. I appreciate it.

Nick Gomez: Stay safe, John. Thanks for having me on the MBI podcast.

Speaker 1: My pleasure. This has been another episode of Inside Modular, the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Jim Dunn, President and Founder of Stack Modular. Jim is here to talk about steel-frame modular buildings and to catch us up on Stack's recent projects. Jim, how are you today?

[Jim]
I'm pretty darn good, John. Thanks for having me.

[John]
It's my pleasure. So, let's jump right in. Tell me about Stack Modular. How did the company get started, and where do you operate?

[Jim]
Sure. About 12 or 13 years ago, I was a low-rung engineer in California, and I met a young lady who said that China is the future. I ventured over to China, and while that relationship didn't last, the business did. I started Stack Modular, and we primarily operate in Canada and Asia.

[John]
That's quite a journey. Now, you mentioned that Stack Modular builds with steel. Why is that?

[Jim]
We've always found steel to be a suitable material for our modular buildings. In China, we didn't have an abundance of timber or wood, so steel was the natural choice. Additionally, steel offers several advantages, including durability, high seismic resistance, design flexibility, fire resistance, and less warping and mold issues compared to wood. Steel is also better suited for transportation over long distances, which is important for us, given our operations between China and North America.

[John]
It makes sense. Steel certainly has its advantages. What's the main difference between steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular construction? Are there other differences beyond the ones you've mentioned?

[Jim]
Certainly. While steel-frame modular and wood-frame modular share many similarities, there are some key differences. Steel-frame modular buildings are typically designed for greater heights than wood-frame structures. They offer more design flexibility because steel has a higher strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for less structural intrusion into room layouts. Steel is fire-resistant, making it a safer choice in terms of fire protection. Steel modules are also less susceptible to warping and mold issues, which can be problematic with wood. Additionally, steel-frame modular buildings tend to be more durable and have a longer lifespan.

[John]
Those are some significant advantages. Now, you recently worked on a project in California that combined steel-frame modules with site-built components. Can you tell us more about that project and how it worked?

[Jim]
Certainly. In California, we're working on a hybrid project that combines steel-frame modular units with site-built components. In this project, the first three stories of the building are site-built using concrete construction. Above those three levels, we stack the steel-frame modular units. This approach allows us to take advantage of the speed and efficiency of modular construction while accommodating specific site requirements and building needs.

[John]
That sounds like an interesting approach. What's the installation process like for a project like this, where you have a combination of site-built and modular components? Are there any special considerations?

[Jim]
The installation process for a hybrid project like this involves several steps. First, the site-built components, such as the concrete foundation and the first three stories of the building, are constructed on-site. Simultaneously, in our factory, we build the steel-frame modular units that will be stacked on top of the site-built portion.

Once the modules are complete and have passed quality checks, they are transported to the project site. The modules are then lifted into place by cranes and stacked on top of the site-built structure. On-site, the teams work on connecting MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) systems vertically, tying them into the corridor system. The corridors and finishing work are typically completed on-site.

The key to a successful project like this is coordination between the various teams, including architects, engineers, the modular provider, and the construction crew. Communication and alignment between all parties are critical to ensure that the modules align seamlessly with the site-built components.

[John]
I can imagine that coordination is essential for a project like this. Speaking of coordination, how does the design process work for a hybrid modular project? Are there any special considerations for architects and engineers?

[Jim]
The design process for a hybrid modular project begins with early collaboration between the modular provider, architects, engineers, and the project's ownership group. It's crucial to involve the modular team from the early sketch stages of the project to ensure that the design accommodates modular construction efficiently.

Architects and engineers need to keep modular construction principles in mind while designing the building. This includes understanding module dimensions, structural considerations, and the need for vertical and horizontal connections between modules. Open-mindedness and a willingness to adapt to modular design principles are essential for a successful project.

Ultimately, the goal is to design with modular construction in mind, optimizing the benefits of both site-built and modular components.

[John]
That makes sense. Are there any special considerations or challenges for the on-site team when working with a hybrid modular project like this?

[Jim]
Yes, there can be challenges for the on-site team when working on a hybrid modular project. One significant consideration is the coordination between the on-site construction crew and the modular provider. Both teams need to work together seamlessly to ensure that the modules fit precisely onto the site-built components.

There may also be differences in the finishing work required for the site-built and modular portions of the building. While modular units are typically 98% complete in terms of interior finishes, some finishing work is still needed on-site, especially in common areas like corridors.

In general, the on-site team needs to adapt to the unique requirements of a hybrid modular project, ensuring that all components align correctly and that MEP systems are integrated smoothly.

[John]
I can see how that coordination and adaptation are essential for a successful project. Do you see hybrid structures like this becoming more common as modular construction gains popularity?

[Jim]
Absolutely. Hybrid structures offer a practical solution for many construction projects. While modular construction is known for its speed and efficiency, there will always be site-specific requirements and design considerations that are best addressed through traditional site-built construction. Hybrid modular projects allow for the best of both worlds, combining the benefits of modular and site-built components. As modular construction continues to gain popularity, we can expect to see more hybrid projects that leverage the strengths of both approaches.

[John]
That's a great perspective. So, what's next for Stack Modular? Do you have any exciting projects or developments on the horizon?

[Jim]
Our focus is on continuing to deliver high-quality modular solutions while adapting to changing circumstances. One of our primary challenges right now is navigating the complexities of international trade and regulations, especially between China and North America. We want to ensure that our clients are protected and that we can continue to provide efficient modular solutions for housing and building needs.

As for exciting projects, who knows what the future holds? We're always looking for opportunities to push the boundaries of modular construction. We could see ourselves working on even

 taller and more complex projects in the coming years, including potentially 40 or 50-story structures right here in North America.

[John]
That's ambitious and exciting. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Stack Modular. Thanks so much for joining us today, Jim. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.

[Jim]
Thank you, John. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to a future with exciting modular projects.

Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by Christian Lawrence, founder, and CEO of Rise Modular. Christian is here to talk about how Rise got started and his thoughts on where modular is headed. Christian, thanks for calling in today.

Christian: Thanks for having me.

John: It's my pleasure. So, tell me about yourself. I've read that your background originally was in economics. So, how did you find your way into modular construction?

Christian: Sure, so my background is in finance. I worked in investment banking and private equity. I've always been passionate about real estate and design. About four years ago, I moved back to Minneapolis from the East Coast and got involved in real estate development. I was working on one development deal in particular, a 20-unit apartment building, and I wanted to explore off-site construction and modular specifically. I had read about modular construction being commonplace in parts of Europe and Asia and growing in popularity on the coasts. However, I hadn't seen it done in the Midwest.

I toured several modular companies in the upper Midwest, primarily focused on single-family homes, but none of them could handle a project of the size I was envisioning. That's when I realized there was a significant gap in the market for large-scale commercial modular construction in the Midwest. I became captivated by the idea of industrializing construction in a manufacturing environment, and that's how I got into modular construction.

John: That's a fascinating journey. So, what was the process of starting Rise Modular? What was the first step?

Christian: The first step was conducting market research to validate the concept and demand for commercial modular construction in the Midwest. I mapped out modular companies across the country that could handle a 20-unit apartment building and found a significant white space in the central United States with no suppliers capable of serving this market. I spoke with developers and contractors to validate the demand.

Once we confirmed the demand, the next step was building the right team and finding the right facility. We spent a lot of time assembling a team of industry experts and identifying a facility that could be retrofitted into a state-of-the-art modular manufacturing plant.

John: It sounds like assembling the right team was crucial to your success. Looking at your website, it's evident that you have a strong team. How did you go about building such a team, especially as someone relatively new to the industry?

Christian: We're very proud of the team we've assembled at Rise Modular. We believe we have one of the best teams of experienced industry leaders. We recruited team members from all over the country, including Colorado, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and other states. We cast a wide net to find the right people with the necessary expertise.

Since there are few suppliers in the upper Midwest with experience in large-scale apartment buildings and hotels, it was critical to put together a team capable of handling such projects. Our team members have diverse backgrounds and experiences, and they bring their expertise to every aspect of our operation.

John: That's impressive. So, you mentioned that Rise Modular primarily focuses on multi-family and hospitality projects. Can you elaborate on why you chose to focus on these sectors rather than others?

Christian: Certainly. My initial entry into modular construction was driven by a personal development project, a 20-unit apartment building. I couldn't find a supplier capable of delivering a project of that size in the upper Midwest. After conducting market research, I realized there was significant demand for multi-family and hospitality projects in this region. However, there were no suppliers serving these markets.

Rise Modular was founded to meet that unmet demand. We found that within a 750-mile radius of our plant in Owatonna, Minnesota, over 85% of units in the multi-family and hospitality sectors were built using wood, while less than 15% were built with concrete and steel. Wood construction is cost-effective within this market, making it the natural choice for us. As a result, we've primarily focused on wood-framed modular construction for multi-family and hospitality projects.

John: It makes sense to cater to the existing market demand. Speaking of projects, I understand Rise Modular has recently completed its first apartment building. Can you tell us more about that project and whether you encountered any surprises during construction?

Christian: Absolutely. We're thrilled to have completed our first apartment building. The project went well, and we just finished stacking the last module this past Saturday, which was a significant milestone for us as a company. In just two years, we've gone from an idea to successfully completing our first project, which

 we're very proud of.

As for surprises during construction, I wouldn't say there were any significant surprises. Our team has worked diligently to ensure a smooth construction process, and we've had great collaboration with our partners and contractors. It's been an exciting journey to bring this project to completion.

John: Congratulations on that achievement. It's indeed a significant milestone. I also see that Rise Modular has a new factory, which is approximately 141,000 square feet. Can you tell us more about what you're currently working on and how this new factory benefits your operations?

Christian: Our new factory is a significant asset for Rise Modular. We spent a lot of time searching for the right facility, and we were fortunate to find one that could be retrofitted into a state-of-the-art modular manufacturing plant. The facility is approximately 141,000 square feet, and it's located in Owatonna, Minnesota.

With this new factory, we're well-positioned to execute our projects efficiently. We have the capability to run about a million square feet of production per year once we reach full capacity. Additionally, the facility is designed to be expandable, so we have room for growth in the future.

Currently, we're focused on building multi-family projects, including market-rate, affordable, student housing, senior housing, and permanent supportive housing. While we anticipate that hospitality projects will pick up in the next year or so, our primary focus right now is on multi-family construction.

John: That sounds like an impressive facility and a strategic location. Regarding construction materials, I understand Rise Modular predominantly uses wood framing. Can you explain why you've chosen wood over steel and what advantages you see with wood framing?

Christian: Yes, Rise Modular primarily uses wood framing for our projects. We made this choice based on our market research, which revealed that within a 750-mile radius of our plant, over 85% of units delivered in the multi-family and hospitality sectors were constructed using wood framing. Less than 15% were built with concrete and steel.

Wood construction is generally cost-effective within this market, even though there have been fluctuations in lumber prices. Building with wood allows us to construct buildings of up to five stories over a two-story podium cost-effectively. Therefore, considering the market demand and economics, wood framing is the natural choice for us at this time.

John: It makes sense to align with the existing market conditions. Switching gears a bit, I'd like to ask about affordable housing. What is your perspective on the role of the modular construction industry in addressing affordable housing? How do you envision the industry contributing to this critical issue?

Christian: Affordable housing is a pressing issue nationwide, affecting communities across the country. Technology, including modular construction, can play a significant role in addressing this challenge. Modular construction offers construction cost savings and time efficiencies that can help make affordable housing more achievable.

At Rise Modular, we believe that modular construction can be a key solution to increase the supply of affordable housing. By using construction cost savings derived from modular methods and reducing construction timelines, we can help provide more affordable housing options. We're actively working with affordable developers and non-profit organizations to serve this market and believe that modular construction can play a pivotal role in making affordable housing more accessible.

John: That's an important perspective, and modular construction can certainly contribute to addressing the affordable housing crisis. Shifting back to your region, what's the demand like for modular construction in Minneapolis and the upper Midwest? Does it mirror the strong demand seen on the coasts, particularly for affordable housing?

Christian: The demand for modular construction in Minneapolis and the upper Midwest is robust and significant, mirroring the strong demand seen on the coasts. Affordable housing remains a critical issue in this region as well, and there is substantial demand for multi-family and hospitality projects. Modular construction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for meeting this demand.

While you often hear about California and other coastal regions, the affordable housing issue is a nationwide challenge. The upper Midwest is no exception, and we're committed to addressing this issue by delivering quality modular projects in the region.

John: It's essential to recognize that affordable housing is a challenge that transcends geographic boundaries. Regarding the ongoing pandemic, I've been asking guests on the show how they've been navigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Can you share any strategies or measures that Rise Modular has implemented to keep employees safe and productive during this time?

Christian: Certainly. Safety is a top priority at Rise Modular, and we've implemented robust COVID-19 safety measures both at our plant and headquarters. We follow CDC guidelines and local regulations to ensure the safety of our employees and partners. Some of the measures we've implemented include social distancing, mask requirements, daily temperature checks, and enhanced sanitization protocols.

We're fortunate that, to date, we have not had a positive COVID-19 case within our workforce. We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and will continue to follow our safety plans to protect our employees and partners.

John: It's great to hear that you've been successful in maintaining a safe work environment. Finally, what's the vision for Rise Modular over the next 10 years? Where do you see the company heading in the future?

Christian: Over the next 10 years, we anticipate that modular construction will become more commonplace as a construction methodology across the country, including the Midwest. We aim to play a role in this expansion and growth. There is a substantial demand for modular construction, far exceeding the current capacity of existing plants.

Our long-term vision includes the establishment of multiple modular manufacturing plants across the country to serve different geographic markets. While we're focused on the Midwest currently, we plan to expand our footprint in the future.

However, in the short term, our primary focus is on executing our projects and delivering quality modular construction solutions to our customers. We want to ensure that we provide the best possible service and meet the demands of the market. Once we have successfully executed our projects, we will start planning for geographic expansion.

John: It's an exciting vision for the future, and I'm sure many are eager to see the growth of Rise Modular. Christian, I want to thank you for your time today. This has been a great conversation, and I want to extend my congratulations on completing your first apartment building. Here's to many more successful projects in the future.

Christian: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.

Introduction:
Welcome, everyone. My name is John McMullen, and I'm the Marketing Director here at MBI. Today, I'm joined by John Hanis-Bacani, MBI's Government Affairs Director. John's here today to catch us all up on MBI's efforts to support modular construction around the country. John, thanks for being on today. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.

Tell Me About Yourself:
So, tell me about yourself. What's your background?
John Hanis-Bacani: Prior to coming to MBI, I spent about 21 years in the government affairs industry, working for a Fortune 30 company in corporate law. I managed the local, state, and federal government affairs for the Mid-Atlantic region. So, I have a long history of working in that environment and trying to do what's best to make sure the industry that we're in has the ability to excel.

What Is the Importance of Government Affairs?
John McMullen: Excellent. So, generally speaking, what's the importance of government affairs here at MBI?
John Hanis-Bacani: Here at MBI, it's kind of two facets. One is making sure that we take care of issues that arise with our members, which will always be a priority for us. Such as delays in plan approval, working with code officials, and maybe misinterpreting the codes. Just making sure that we have relationships with those code officials and those regulatory entities. So, when our members do have an issue, we're able to step in and be that mediator to resolve the problem as quickly as we can.

What's Been Going On in New York?
John McMullen: Gotcha. I know you're doing a lot of work internally. Tell me about MBI's Government Affairs Committee, which you chair here as a staff member. Who's on that, and what purpose does it serve?
John Hanis-Bacani: So, we have 17 committee members from all parts of the industry, whether it's relocatable, permanent modular construction. They serve as a sounding board for us to discuss ideas that we may want to explore, such as being proactive in removing barriers in the marketplace or opening up more opportunities for our industry.

COVID-19 Impact on MBI:
John McMullen: So, get me caught up. What's been going on? Well, you know, as you know, with the year we've had in 2020, COVID-19 was certainly front and center. Fortunately for us, we had some things in place that we put together prior to COVID-19 hitting that really helped us promote our industry during the pandemic and what our industry was able to offer. Part of that was with our phone-to-action system that allowed members to reach over 300 local, city, state, and federal officials directly and involve them. Also, our partnership with the National Governors Association allowed us to reach out to literally every governor and provincial premier to let them know what our industry was able to do and steer them to our crisis response page.

Crisis Response Page:
John McMullen: Very nice. That's really given us a government affairs reach almost across North America, all the U.S., Canada, dealing with issues for a lot of our members. What else has been going on? I know there's a lot happening in New York. Is that right?
John Hanis-Bacani: Yes. We're very fortunate this year that we hired an actual New York lobbyist to be on the ground in Albany to make sure that we were protecting the industry in a state that is very highly regulated. What we were able to accomplish this year was there were three bills presented, one from Mayor de Blasio in New York City, all of which would have prevented the industry from doing business as usual. They would have required using union workers on any projects in New York and brought in the prevailing wage issue. During the extended session when they came back, we were able to prevent all three of those bills from being brought to the floor for a vote. We continue to work with our lobbyists as we prepare for the election to see if those bill sponsors are re-elected. If so, we'll be prepared to take steps to defeat them again in the next session if needed.

DC:
John McMullen: Gotcha. Speaking of lobbying firms, I know we have one in D.C., correct?
John Hanis-Bacani: We have a D.C. lobbying firm that's done a great job for us. They help us not only meet with members of Congress but also develop relationships with leadership at FEMA and HUD. They're working on the ground to support issues like the Payroll Protection Plan, and we're working with them to make sure they're focused on efforts directly impacting our industry.

CMHC:
John McMullen: Speaking of federal stuff, I know we work a lot with our Canadian friends, CMHC. We've made a lot of progress with them lately. Can you tell me about that?
John Hanis-Bacani: Absolutely. When I came on board in 2018, CMHC wouldn't even finance any modular projects. So, we first removed that restriction to make sure they would finance them. Then we found out they needed more guidance on financing modular projects. We shared guidelines with CMHC that were developed in collaboration with NIBS (National Institute of Building Sciences) and Fannie Mae. CMHC plans to adopt these guidelines for financing modular projects.

Town Halls:
John McMullen: So, we have a committee, we have you on the ground, we have lobbying firms doing workforce. Tell me about the town hall calls that you host throughout the year. What purpose do they serve, and what gets accomplished through those?
John Hanis-Bacani: This year, we've had five town hall calls in New York, Arizona, Massachusetts, California, and Texas. These calls help us build relationships with those regulating our industry and give our members an opportunity to have a voice directly with leadership and inspectors they work with. They can discuss issues like delays in plan review, guidelines, and work collaboratively to find solutions. For example, we passed a law in Texas that removed a four-story height restriction on modular construction and worked with the department to make sure they had time to implement it. These town halls are invaluable for our industry and members.

Richie Torres:
John McMullen: Speaking of relationships, there's a future congressman coming into New York, Richie Torres, I believe his name is. So, you've reached out to him, and we've got a meeting scheduled or a call?
John Hanis-Bacani: Yes, we have a call today with Richie Torres and his chief of staff. Mr. Torres is soon to be elected, coming out of the Bronx district. He's passionate about affordable housing and making sure he's doing the best for his constituency. He's shown interest in our industry's ability to build faster, more efficiently, with less waste.

 We plan to have a Zoom call today and set up a tour for him to visit one of our member facilities and meet with one of our board members to see modular construction in action.

Seals Program:
John McMullen: Very exciting. One last thing I wanted to touch on, since your role here touches the whole membership, there's a way for the membership to support you through our SEALS program. Can you tell me about the SEALS program, what it is, and how it helps us?
John Hanis-Bacani: The SEALS program has been around for a long time, and it involves each member committing to buy a seal for every module they build. A hundred percent of that income goes to supporting our government affairs efforts. These funds have allowed us to hire lobbyists in D.C. and New York City, join the National Governors Association, and do the work needed to protect the industry, remove barriers, and open up opportunities. The SEALS program is crucial for our efforts.

Outro:
John McMullen: Well, thanks so much, John. I know government affairs is one of the most important services MBI offers, and it's been great to get caught up on everything that's been going on. We should definitely do this again.
John Hanis-Bacani: Thanks, John. I appreciate it.
John McMullen: My name is John McMullen. This has been another episode of "Inside Modular," the podcast of commercial modular construction. Until next time.
