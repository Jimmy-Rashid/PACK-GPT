SECONDARY SUITES IN SEMI-DETACHED HOMES | FINAL PROGRAM FOR PHASE 1A

Zoning Districts:
- Permitted in R4, R5, R6, R12, and RM6 Districts
- Due to fire separation requirements, secondary suites will not be permitted in up/down duplexes, where dwelling units are above or below other dwelling units.

Eligible Lots:
To add a semi-detached home in the R4, R5, R6, or RM6 Districts, a lot must be at least:
- 557.4 m2 (6,000 sq. ft.) and 15.0 m (49.2 ft.) wide.
To add a semi-detached home in the R12 District, a lot must be at least:
- 306.57 m2 (3,300 sq. ft.) and 9.15 m (30 ft.) wide on lots with lanes, or
- 306.57 m2 (3,300 sq. ft.) and 13.7 m (45 ft.) wide on lots without lanes.
To add secondary suites to a semi-detached home, an eligible lot must have:
- A semi-detached home (two attached units placed side-by-side or front-to-back).
- Vehicular access to the rear yard from the side or rear of the property, via an open lane or residential street.

Units per Lot:
- Eligible lots may have up to 4 units.

Ownership:
- A semi-detached home may be stratified into two “primary” units (each side may be sold separately). However, a secondary suite may not be separately stratified (sold separately) from a primary unit.
- A secondary suite may be rented out as a long-term rental unit. Short-term rentals will not be permitted in secondary suites.
- The owner will not be required to live on the property. If the owner lives off-site, an annual house rental business license will be required.

Floor Area:
- Maximum floor area for a secondary suite:
  - There is no maximum floor area for a secondary suite, subject to the following:
    - the secondary suite must be contained within a semi-detached unit; and
    - a floor containing a secondary suite can be no greater in area than the storey next above or below it.
- The floor area of a secondary suite will not count toward the total floor area permitted for the semi-detached home.
- Ground level suites and basements containing secondary suites may be added to a two-storey semi-detached home.
- Minimum floor area for a secondary suite:
  - 32.52 m2 (350 sq. ft.)

Additional Considerations:
- A “ground level suite” means a suite at or below ground level with an accessible path to the front door that is certified as meeting universal design standards.
- The top floor of a semi-detached home has no maximum size but must be at least one third of the permitted above grade floor area.

Height:
- Maximum height for a semi-detached home with a secondary suite other than a ground level suite:
  - Two storeys plus basement; and
  - Up to 9.0 m (29.5 ft.) for a sloping roof or 7.4 m (24.3 ft.) for a flat roof.
- Maximum height for a semi-detached home with a ground level suite:
  - Two storeys plus ground level suite; and
  - Up to 10.5m (34.4 ft.) for a sloping roof, or 8.9m (29.2 ft.) for a flat roof.

Setbacks:
- Setbacks for semi-detached homes will be as per existing Zoning Bylaw regulations.

Lot Coverage:
- Lot coverage for semi-detached homes will be as per existing Zoning Bylaw regulations.
- 70% maximum for impervious surfaces.

Parking:
Required parking:
- 2 parking spaces will be required on the property (one per side of the semi-detached home). These must be uncovered or in a carport.
- Parking spaces for suites must meet the City standard for an accessible parking space.
- Parking spaces for ground level suites should meet the City standard for a van accessible parking space.

Additional considerations:
- Each parking space must include an energized outlet capable of providing Level 2 charging for an electric vehicle.
- Additional (unrequired) parking spaces may be included on the site and may be uncovered, in a carport, or in a garage.

Environmental Design:
- Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code will need to be met for newly constructed semi-detached homes with secondary suites.

Outdoor Space:
- A minimum 4 m2 (43.06 sq. ft.) of private outdoor space per suite is encouraged.
- The protection and/or provision of trees as per the Burnaby Tree Bylaw.

Access/Addressing:
- “S” suffixes will be added to the main address to identify secondary suites (e.g. S1–1234 Main Street).

Servicing & Utilities:
- Servicing for secondary suites in semi-detached homes will be as per secondary suites in single-family homes.
- An annual supplementary utility fee will be charged for each secondary suite that is rented out.

Application Process:
- A building permit will be required to construct a suite in a semi-detached home.
- A “How-To” guide will be provided to assist with the application process.
- A pre-approved design library will be created to accompany the program.

Required parking must be accessed from a lane or, subject to the approval of the General Manager Engineering, a side or rear street.

NOTES:
- Housing Choices Phase 1b is launching summer 2023 and may result in updates to the requirements described above once implemented in 2024.
- Laneway homes in Agricultural (A) zoning districts are being considered separately as part of an agricultural lands review starting in 2023.
