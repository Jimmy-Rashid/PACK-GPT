LANEWAY HOMES | FINAL PROGRAM FOR PHASE 1A

Zoning Districts:
- Permitted in R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R9, R10, R11, R12, and RM6 Districts

Eligible Lots Properties must have:
- a single-family home; and
- vehicular access to the rear yard from the side or rear of the property, via an open lane or residential street.

Additional considerations:
- Corner lots or double-fronted lots (“through lots”) that do not have access to an open lane will require access approval from the Engineering Department.
- If a lot is near a stream, Streamside Protection and Enhancement Area regulations may limit the ability to construct a laneway home. (See Section 6.23 of the Zoning Bylaw).

Units per Lot:
- Eligible lots may have up to 3 units.

Tenure:
- A lot with a laneway home must remain under a single title. This means that a laneway home cannot be stratified or otherwise subdivided, and cannot be sold separately from the main home.
- A laneway home may be rented out as a long-term rental unit. Short-term rentals will not be permitted in laneway homes.
- The owner will not be required to live on the property. However, if the owner lives off-site, an annual house rental business license will be required.

Floor Area:
- Maximum floor area for a laneway home:
  - Up to 20% of the lot area, but no larger than 140 m2 (1,507 sq. ft.).
- Minimum floor area for a laneway home:
  - 32.52 m2 (350 sq. ft.).
  
Floor area calculation for a laneway home will exclude:
- Floor area of the principal dwelling
- Floor area of carports that are attached to the laneway home
- Floor area of any accessory buildings that are not attached to the laneway home (e.g. garages, sheds, workshops, bike sheds/lockers)

Height:
- Maximum height for a laneway home:
  - No more than 2 storeys; and
  - Up to 7.6 m (24.93 ft.) for a sloping roof; or
  - Up to 6.7 m (21.98 ft.) for a flat roof.

Additional considerations:
- The height of a laneway home will be measured from the lowest point (lower of the natural or finished grade) on the perimeter of the laneway home.
- A laneway home cannot exceed the maximum height permitted for the principal dwelling, as permitted in the Zoning Bylaw.
- Basements are permitted in laneway homes and will count as one storey.

Location on a Lot:
- Minimum setbacks for a laneway home:
  - 2.4 m (7.87 ft.) from the main house, a detached garage, or other accessory building
  - 1.2 m (3.94 ft.) from the rear lot line and side lot line

Additional considerations:
- On a corner lot, the rear yard is the area furthest from the front lot line. The front lot line is usually the narrowest street frontage.
- On a corner lot, the side yard setback from the flanking street will be the same as for the main house.
- On a double-fronted lot (“through lot”), there is technically no rear yard, so a laneway home should be located behind the main residence.
- If a lot is near a street/lane intersection, the regulations to maintain vision clearance at intersections may impact the siting of a laneway home (Zoning Bylaw section 6.13).
- An unsprinklered laneway home may not be located further than 45 m (147.64 ft.) from a lot line abutting a road.

Lot Coverage:
- 45% maximum for buildings/structures
- 70% maximum for impervious surfaces

Parking:
- Required parking:
  - 1 parking space will be required on the property. This must be uncovered or in a carport and meet the City standard for a van accessible parking space (Zoning Bylaw Section 800.3.1).

Additional considerations:
- The parking space may be located within the side yard setback, subject to vision clearance at intersection regulations (Zoning Bylaw section 6.13).
- The parking area must include an energized outlet capable of providing Level 2 charging for an electric vehicle.
- Additional parking spaces may be provided on the property but will not be required. These may be uncovered, in a carport, or in a garage.
- Parking/storage for bikes, strollers, etc. may be provided in detached accessory buildings, attached “bikeports,” or bike lockers.

Environmental Design:
- Laneway homes must meet BC Energy Step Code Level 3.
- An additional 0.5 m (1.64 ft.) in height may be permitted to support BC Energy Step Code 5 or BC Zero Carbon Step Code buildings.

Outdoor Space:
- Trees must be retained or replaced as per the Burnaby Tree Bylaw.
- Private outdoor space for the laneway home will be encouraged: a minimum 4 m2 (43.06 sq. ft.) private patio or minimum 3 m2 (32.29 sq. ft.) deck or balcony.

Access/Addressing:
- A minimum 0.9 m (3 ft.) wide pathway is required from the street to the laneway home.
- “L” suffixes will be added to the main address to identify laneway homes (e.g. L1–1234 Main Street).

Servicing & Utilities:
- Separate sewer, water, and power services will be required for the laneway home.
- An annual supplementary utility fee will be charged for a laneway home.

Application Process:
- A building permit will be required to construct a laneway home.
- A “How-To” guide will be provided to assist with the application process.
- A pre-approved design library will be created to accompany the program.

Heritage:
- Exceptions to these regulations may be considered to preserve heritage buildings, through the Heritage Revitalization Agreement process.
