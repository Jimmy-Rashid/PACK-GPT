First nations referrals on
the housing choice program
referrals on the program were sent in march 2022 to the slilwta (tsleil-waututh) nation, the skwxwu7mesh 
uxwumixw (squamish nation), the xwmkwym (musqueam) indian band, and the kwikw
m (kwikwetlem) first
nation, on whose territories burnaby is located. The referrals provided information on the proposed housing types and
forthcoming consultation activities and invited comments and/or other engagement.
The slilwta (tsleil-waututh) nation and the kwikw
m (kwikwetlem) first nation had no comments at that time,
but asked to receive updates on the program. The skwxwu7mesh uxwumixw (squamish nation) had the following 
comments:
our climate action managers recommend the proponent consider the implementation of climate resilient
standards (e. G. , hepa smoke filters, passive cooling, and increased storm water drainage capacity) and ensure
the building design regulations incorporate future climate impacts (increased temperatures, increased risk to
fire and smoke, increased rainfall and wind, as well as changes to external flood risks). We also recommend
regulations ensure buildings are designed to net zero carbon emissions (considering clean power/heat, building
envelope, renewables, and embodied carbon) and the highest sustainability standards (including considerations
for water conservation, storm water management, waste management, transportation, environmental
conservation, and food security).
 We request further detail around how the project will seek to meet sustainability and climate standards.
 Our preference would be for more affordable housing options (such as the smaller units you mentioned)
over single family homes - from both a sustainability and equity perspective.
These comments are being considered in preparing the draft program recommendations. Staff will seek further input
from the host first nations on the draft program recommendations to ensure that they reflect their priorities.
